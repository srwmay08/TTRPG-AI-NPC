        "description": "MEMORANDUM\n\nTO: The Watchful Masters, The Lords of Waterdeep, Office of the Open Lord\n\nFROM: Captain Hyustus Statget, City Watch – Dock Ward Precinct\n\nDATE: Ches 19, 1492 DR\n\nSUBJECT: URGENT REPORT: Mass Disappearances at Castle Waterdeep & Loss of Subsequent Search Personnel\n\nEsteemed Lords, Watchful Masters,\n\nIt is with grave concern and a heavy heart that I submit this report detailing a catastrophic series of events that commenced two days prior within the very walls of Castle Waterdeep, and the subsequent, deeply troubling loss of City Watch personnel and other specialists.\n\nIncident Summary:\n\nDuring a formal dance held at Castle Waterdeep on the evening of Ches 17, a significant number of esteemed attendees, including nobles of Waterdeep, visiting high dignitaries, and crucial foreign emissaries, vanished without a trace. Preliminary investigations, spearheaded by Lord Lohrmahr, indicate the involvement of a female djinni, identified as Sogesonoy. This entity reportedly smuggled a golden, ornate bottle – hereafter referred to as 'the artifact' – into the event. Witnesses state she placed this artifact on a small table. It has since been determined that any individual who touches or 'rubs' this artifact is immediately spirited away. The djinni herself was observed hovering above the guests, seemingly unconcerned, while partaking in the buffet before presumably departing. The artifact, however, was deliberately left behind.\n\nThe implications of these disappearances are, as you are acutely aware, severe. The loss of these high-profile individuals risks diplomatic incidents of the highest order, potentially leading to conflict if they are not recovered swiftly and safely.\n\nEscalation – Loss of Search Parties:\n\nIn the three days following the initial incident, under the direction of the Lords, multiple attempts have been made to ascertain the fate of the missing persons and effect a rescue. I must report, with profound regret, that every team dispatched has met the same fate. This includes:\n\n    Numerous squads of City Watch guards.\n\n    Several individuals described as 'supposed professionals' and specialists in arcane matters.\n\nNone have returned. None have sent word. The artifact has, in essence, consumed our rescue efforts, adding to the already critical list of the missing. The loss of so many good Watch members is a blow to our ranks and morale.\n\nCurrent Directives & Concerns:\n\nLords, Masters, the situation is dire and escalating. We are facing a potent magical threat that has already claimed dozens of influential individuals and a significant number of our own forces. Standard methods of investigation and rescue have proven not only ineffective but actively detrimental.\n\nThe City Watch stands ready to provide any support to such a team, but I cannot, in good conscience, order more of my guards into that bottle until we have a clearer understanding of the destination and a viable strategy for confronting the djinni and reversing the transformations.\n\nLord Lohrmahr has offered a reward of 1,000 gold pieces for every noble or diplomat successfully rescued. While the return of these dignitaries is paramount, I must express my deep concern for the City Watch members and other Waterdhavian citizens already lost to this artifact. Their recovery is, to me and the Watch, of equal importance, though they were not included in the aforementioned bounty.\n\nYour immediate attention and decisive action are most humbly, and urgently, requested.\n\nFor the Watch, and for Waterdeep,\n\nCaptain Hyustus Statget\nCity Watch, Castle Ward Precinct\nWaterdeep",
