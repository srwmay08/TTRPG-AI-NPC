Brigit Crommer (née Stonebeard)

Matriarch and Master Artisan of the Horns of Moradin

Birth & Early Life:
Brigit was born into the prestigious Stonebeard family, renowned for their fine craftsmanship in jewelry and devotional relics. Raised in Mirabar, she studied both forgecraft and clerical teachings of Moradin from her earliest years. A gifted child, she excelled in filigree work and rune-engraving before reaching her first century.

Growth:
Drawn to the complexity of combining art, metal, and faith, Brigit eventually journeyed to Waterdeep to study foreign forging styles. There, she met Duth III during a guild summit. Their union—equal parts strategic and romantic—strengthened both families. As matron of the Crommer clan, she quickly assumed responsibility for the Horns of Moradin line, insisting every instrument carry both aesthetic beauty and spiritual significance.

Current Life:
Now in her 170s, Brigit is a revered artisan-priest, holding ceremonial and practical authority over the crafting of sacred brass instruments. She is stern yet respected by her peers, and considered nearly peerless in combining dwarven metallurgy with religious artistry. She watches over her family with a fierce sense of duty and pride.
