Kaideu Crommer

Young Heir to the Crommer Legacy

Birth & Early Life:
Born just 28 years ago in the heart of Waterdeep’s artisan quarter, Kaideu is the only child of Duth III and Brigit Crommer. From the moment of his birth, he was destined to inherit not only the Crommer name but the weight of generations of legacy. As a young dwarf, he was precocious, fascinated by both the clanging hammers of the forge and the haunting tones of the family's brass instruments.

Growth:
Tutored by both his parents and master craftsfolk, Kaideu has taken a special interest in combining mechanical function with musical output. He has already begun assembling his own crude horns and contraptions, much to the amusement (and occasional dismay) of the staff. Though dwarven maturity is slow, Kaideu is unusually expressive and spirited, even quoting human ballads much to his mother's chagrin.

Current Life:
Still considered a child by dwarven standards, Kaideu spends his days under constant guidance—dividing time between the workshop, the forge-shrine, and the rare musical performances hosted by the family. His admiration for Mattrim “Threestrings” and his dreams of one day playing a true Horn of Moradin make him a blend of reverent and rebellious. He represents the Crommer future, a spark of curiosity in a tradition-bound house.
