Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg

Wandering Bard, Friend of the Crommers

Birth & Early Life:
Mattrim was born to a modest seamstress and dockworker in Waterdeep’s Dock Ward. From a young age, he showed an uncanny ear for rhythm and song, often making up tunes to entertain his friends or soothe his siblings during hard winters. He never quite fit the mold of a dockhand, instead slipping between taverns, sailors, and old storytellers who offered him scraps of song and supper.

Growth:
After a brief stint as a member of a short-lived adventuring band, Mattrim’s trajectory took a lazy swerve when he survived a harrowing dungeon crawl. Swearing off heroics, he became a tavern bard—albeit one who surprised his listeners with his depth of lore and soul. His obsession with dwarven history and music led him to study Clan Melairkyn and the Horns of Moradin. That path, though unusual for a human, brought him into cautious contact with the Crommers.

Current Life:
Though widely known for his catchy and humorous tavern tunes, Mattrim leads a dual life. Behind closed doors, he is a rare human honored by the Crommers with the chance to perform on their sacred horns. His understanding of dwarven reverence and his talent with brass have earned him the guarded admiration of Brigit and Borin alike. He still lounges in Dock Ward, seemingly carefree, but in truth, he carries the musical echoes of dwarven glory within his songs.
