Borin Stonehammer

Captain of the Crommer Guard and Guardian of Legacy

Birth & Early Life:
Born over 230 years ago in Citadel Felbarr, Borin Stonehammer was raised during times of rebuilding and vigilance. The son of a revered battle-smith, Borin was trained from a young age in the arts of war, watchfulness, and worship. His sense of duty and pride in his dwarven heritage were forged in the crucible of hardship and kinship.

Growth:
Borin arrived in Waterdeep during Duth IIâ€™s early years of ambition, and he was quickly recruited not as a mercenary, but as a full guardian of the Crommer vision. He saw in Duth II the rare fusion of craftsman and dreamer. Over decades of loyal service, Borin rose to captain of the Crommer guard, establishing the security culture and traditions that continue to this day.

Current Life:
Now a living relic of dwarven honor and resolve, Borin continues to serve with pride, despite his advancing years. His beard, a map of age and glory, remains meticulously braided. He rarely speaks unless it matters, and his words are often sought as wisdom by Duth III and even Brigit. In Kaideu, he sees not only a child to protect, but the ember of a future worth guarding. Many suspect that when he finally lays down his shield, it will be before Moradin himself.
