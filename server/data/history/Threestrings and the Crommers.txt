"Threestrings" and the Crommers

The connection between Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg and the illustrious Crommer family is an unusual one, built on a shared, though differently expressed, reverence for dwarven heritage and artistry. Long before his catchy tune about Durnan's retirement echoed through the taverns of Waterdeep, Mattrim was a scholar of song, his passions running deeper than fleeting popular fancy. He dedicated years to unearthing and performing the ancient, often overlooked ballads of Clan Melairkyn, the sagas of the depths of Undermountain, and the stirring accounts of the Troll Wars.

It was this dedication to dwarven lore that first brought him to the periphery of the Crommer's world. Borin Stonehammer, the steadfast leader of the Crommer guard, a dwarf who valued tradition, heard whispers of a human bard who sang of dwarven triumphs and tragedies with surprising accuracy and feeling. Borin frequented establishments where such old songs were sung, his ear catching Mattrim's respectful renditions.

Mattrim's fascination extended to dwarven musical traditions. He was particularly captivated by the resonant power of brass instruments, and through meticulous study and an innate musical genius, he developed a remarkable proficiency. The pinnacle of dwarven brass, the Horns of Moradin crafted by the Crommers, became an object of deep artistic aspiration for him.

The true bridge was likely Borin Stonehammer. The elderly shield dwarf, initially skeptical of a human attempting to master an instrument so sacred to Moradin and dwarven culture, observed Mattrim from afar. He would have seen not arrogance, but genuine respect and a profound musical talent. Mattrim, in a moment of either bravery or naivety, sought out a Crommer-made instrument or information about them, and his earnest passion impressed the old guard.

Borin, after satisfying himself of Mattrim's sincere respect for dwarven traditions and even witnessing a display of his surprising skill on a lesser brass horn, might have cautiously mentioned the bard to Brigit. The Crommers, while fiercely protective of their heritage, were also patrons of true artistry, especially when it honored their craft. Intrigued by the notion of a human who not only sang their histories but could potentially master their sacred horns, they granted Mattrim an audience.

Initially, these would have been tests. Mattrim would have performed his dwarven ballads, his voice and lute painting vivid pictures of ancient battles and steadfast kings. Then, after some time, he was allowed to handle, and then play, one of the simpler Crommer horns under Brigit's exacting gaze. To their astonishment, the human played with a skill and soulfulness that few dwarves, let alone an outsider, could achieve. He didn't just play the notes; he seemed to understand the spirit behind the instrument, the invocation of Moradin's strength and artistry.

Thus began the tradition of Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg's private sessions for the Crommer family. In the sanctity of their private chambers, away from the bustle of the brassworks and the city, Mattrim would play. Heâ€™d share his ancient dwarven sagas, and then, with a reverence that satisfied even Brigit, he would bring forth the soul-stirring sounds of a genuine Horn of Moradin. For the Crommers, it was a unique cultural exchange: a human who so deeply understood and could so beautifully articulate aspects of their own heritage. For Mattrim, it was the highest honor, a chance to connect with the very essence of the music and legends he so admired.

His recent, more widespread fame for the Durnan ballad is, in the Crommers' eyes, a charming but ultimately superficial achievement compared to the deep, respectful artistry he shares with their family in private, skillfully coaxing melodies from the sacred brass that bears their name and honors their god.
