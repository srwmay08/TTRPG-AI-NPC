The Crommer Clan: Forgers of Function and Fanfare in Waterdeep

The Crommer family, a name now synonymous with the gleam of polished brass and the resonant call of masterfully crafted horns in Waterdeep, owes its significant standing to the industrious vision of Duth II. Centuries ago, Duth II, a canny shield dwarf with an unparalleled understanding of metallurgy and a keen eye for opportunity, recognized the burgeoning needs of the expanding City of Splendors. While many dwarven clans were content with more traditional strongholds and mining ventures, Duth II saw a future in the city's infrastructure. He established the Crommer Brassworks, a daring and ambitious enterprise for its time, focusing on the production of high-quality brass piping, gears, and fixtures.

His foresight proved immensely profitable. As Waterdeep grew, so did the demand for reliable plumbing, secure conduits, and durable mechanical components. The Crommer Brassworks, with its commitment to dwarven standards of quality and resilience, quickly became the premier supplier for the city's extensive pipeworks, their mark – a stylized forge hammer over a flowing pipe – becoming a symbol of dependability beneath the city's streets and within its walls. Duth II, through shrewd business dealings and by forging strong ties with the city's guilds, particularly the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers and the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild, cemented the Crommer family's prosperity and influence, eventually earning them a respected, albeit sometimes grudgingly acknowledged, place among Waterdeep's influential merchant families.

Beyond the utilitarian, Duth II harbored a deep reverence for Moradin Soulforger, the chief deity of the dwarven pantheon, and a personal passion for music. This led to a prestigious side business: the crafting of exquisite brass musical instruments. Renowned for their clarity, durability, and rich tones, Crommer instruments found favor among bards and temples alike. Of particular note are the legendary "Horns of Moradin." These are not mere instruments but are considered holy relics by many devout dwarves. Each Horn of Moradin is a masterpiece of brasswork, often inlaid with silver and gems, and said to be blessed at the family's private forge-shrine to the Soulforger. It is believed that when sounded by a true believer, these horns can bolster dwarven spirits, instill courage, and some even whisper, can signal for Moradin's favor in times of great need. This dedication to their craft and faith further solidified the Crommer's reputation among their kin.

Today, the Crommer legacy is carried forth by Patriarch Duth III. A dwarf who inherited his ancestor's keen business sense, Duth III is a more polished and urbane figure than his forebears, comfortable navigating the complex social and political landscape of Waterdeep. He is a staunch traditionalist in matters of craft and faith but understands the necessity of adaptation in the ever-changing markets of the great city. He is a respected member of several guilds and maintains the family's crucial relationships with the city's nobility and temple leaders.

By his side is his wife, Brigit Crommer (née Stonebeard). Hailing from a distinguished line of dwarven artisans herself, Brigit is a formidable presence, known for her sharp intellect, her discerning eye for quality control within the brassworks, and her unwavering devotion to Moradin. She often oversees the intricate work on the Horns of Moradin, ensuring each meets the exacting standards set forth by generations of Crommer smiths.

Their young son, Kaideu Crommer, is still a lad by dwarven standards, full of curiosity and already showing a keen interest in the roaring forges and the gleaming instruments his family produces. He spends much of his time under the tutelage of both his parents and the family's master crafters, learning the traditions and skills that are his birthright.

Ensuring the security of the Crommer family, their holdings, and the valuable secrets of their brassworks is Borin Stonehammer, the elderly and revered leader of the Crommer family guard. A shield dwarf of immense experience and unshakeable loyalty, Borin has served the Crommer family for over a century, going on two centuries, first under Duth II's early years and now as Duth III's most trusted guardian. His beard, is so grey, that another white streak has formed its looking even greyer, but still impeccably braided, tells the tale of countless watches and a life dedicated to duty. Borin is a devout follower of Moradin, his shield bearing the symbol of the Soulforger's hammer and anvil. He sees his role not just as a protector of the family, but as a guardian of a vital dwarven enterprise that brings honor to their people and their god. His wisdom is often sought by Duth III, not just on matters of security, but also on upholding the traditions that Moradin himself laid down for the dwarven people.
