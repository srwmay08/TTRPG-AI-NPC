Patriarch of the Crommer Clan

Birth & Early Life:
Born into privilege in the deep forges of Waterdeep’s Trade Ward nearly two centuries ago, Duth III was the firstborn of Duth II's son, Naldur Crommer. Raised within the halls of the Crommer estate and the glowing heat of the Brassworks, Duth III was steeped in both dwarven tradition and the growing influence of commerce in the city above. From a young age, he was taught metallurgy, etiquette, and negotiation alongside hymns to Moradin.

Growth:
While his father focused primarily on production, Duth III showed an unusual aptitude for politics. He spent his youthful decades attending guild meetings, mastering the art of compromise, and slowly expanding the family’s reach beyond infrastructure into artistry and musical relics. He became known for his steady demeanor and sharp insight into Waterdeep’s shifting alliances.

Current Life:
Now in his late 180s, Duth III is the head of the Crommer Brassworks and steward of the family’s spiritual and cultural legacy. He balances tradition with innovation, managing both nobles and guildmasters with practiced grace. Though urbane in manner, he retains the deep, quiet pride of a dwarf whose hands still know the feel of the forge.
