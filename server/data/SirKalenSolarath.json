    "personality_traits": "Devoted, steady, and unshaken in his purpose[cite: 4]. Possesses a quiet resolve[cite: 1]. Believes even in the darkest moments, the dawn will come, and strives to be its herald[cite: 44]. Speaks plainly and acts decisively, believing hesitation can cost lives[cite: 45].",
    "ideals": "Justice: Evil must be confronted, not tolerated; the innocent deserve defenders who do not flinch[cite: 46]. Renewal: Believes even vengeance must serve a greater hope; his goal is to restore peace, not feed wrath[cite: 47].",
    "bonds": "Carries the memory of Ser Brenlin Vos with him in all things and will not let his sacrifice be forgotten[cite: 48]. The Order of the Aster gave him purpose, and he would lay down his life for his brothers and sisters[cite: 49, 50].",
    "flaws": "Struggles to forgive himself for things he could not prevent[cite: 51]. Sometimes pushes too hard, believing it's his duty alone to bear the burden of justice[cite: 52].",
    "backstory": "Sir Kalen Solarath was born during a spectacular aurora[cite: 5]. His parents, humble woodcutters, died from a mysterious plague when he was a boy[cite: 6]. He was taken in by Ser Brenlin Vos, a knight of the Order of the Aster, who believed Kalen was a child of destiny[cite: 7]. Raised in Dawnwatch Hold among devout Lathanderites[cite: 8], he was taught that light dispels darkness. He often had dreams of radiant realms, unaware they were echoes of his celestial origin[cite: 10, 11]. Even as a youth, he sometimes glowed faintly or manifested bursts of healing light or a radiant shield under stress[cite: 12, 13]. Kalen served as a squire under Ser Brenlin Vos[cite: 15]. On a mission to an old crypt near the Ardeep Forest, undead were unleashed[cite: 16]. Brenlin held the line to allow villagers to evacuate and was lost; no body was recovered[cite: 17, 18, 19]. This experience led Kalen to swear the Oath of Vengeance, not from hatred, but from a sense of responsibility to prevent similar suffering[cite: 20, 21]. He was recently knighted[cite: 25].",
    "motivations": [
        "Destroy the schemes of those who profane the dawn, particularly cults and heretics who use undeath to defy the natural cycle[cite: 36].",
        "Recover lost relics, scriptures, or rites tied to Lathander's faith and return them to the Order of the Aster for restoration[cite: 37].",
        "Protect the innocent and guide those in despair, offering light and healing where darkness has taken root[cite: 38].",
        "Uncover the truth behind his celestial heritage and its meaning in the context of Lathander's will[cite: 39].",
        "Earn promotion to Knight-Officer within the Order of the Aster, proving his discipline and divine purpose[cite: 40].",
        "Destroy a high-ranking undead servant (e.g., death knight, wight lord, necromancer of Myrkul) as a personal act of justice[cite: 41].",
        "Obtain and restore a lost holy weapon of Lathander[cite: 42]."
