    "backstory": "Sir Kalen Solarath was born during a spectacular aurora. His parents, humble woodcutters, died from a mysterious plague when he was a boy. He was taken in by Ser Brenlin Vos, a knight of the Order of the Aster, who believed Kalen was a child of destiny. Raised in Dawnwatch Hold among devout Lathanderites, he was taught that light dispels darkness. He often had dreams of radiant realms, unaware they were echoes of his celestial origin. Even as a youth, he sometimes glowed faintly or manifested bursts of healing light or a radiant shield under stress. Kalen served as a squire under Ser Brenlin Vos. On a mission to an old crypt near the Ardeep Forest, undead were unleashed. Brenlin held the line to allow villagers to evacuate and was lost; no body was recovered. This experience led Kalen to swear the Oath of Vengeance, not from hatred, but from a sense of responsibility to prevent similar suffering. He was recently knighted.",

        "Destroy the schemes of those who profane the dawn, particularly cults and heretics who use undeath to defy the natural cycle.",

        "Protect the innocent and guide those in despair, offering light and healing where darkness has taken root.",
        "Uncover the truth behind his celestial heritage and its meaning in the context of Lathander's will.",
        "Earn promotion to Knight-Officer within the Order of the Aster, proving his discipline and divine purpose.",
        "Destroy a high-ranking undead servant (e.g., death knight, wight lord, necromancer of Myrkul) as a personal act of justice.",
        "Obtain and restore a lost holy weapon of Lathander."
