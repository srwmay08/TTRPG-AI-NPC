  "backstory": "Krentz is a gang leader for the Xanathar Guild. The campaign begins with him and four of his thugs picking a fight with a rival Zhentarim agent, Yagra Strongfist, in the Yawning Portal taproom. The brawl is his crew's attempt to assert dominance. Depending on the adventurers' actions, Krentz may be knocked unconscious and dragged out by his cronies, or he might escape thanks to the party's intervention.",

  "gm_notes": "Krentz is the characters' first introduction to the Xanathar Guild. How they deal with him in the initial Yawning Portal brawl should be remembered, as it can affect his reaction to them later. If he survives, he can be found in a Xanathar Guild sewer hideout (Area Q5). Despite being Xanathar Guild, the module states he reports to the Zhentarim wizard Grum'shar in that hideout, a strange alliance the players might question.",
