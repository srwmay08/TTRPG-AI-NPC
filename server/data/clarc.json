    "backstory": "Clarc's flock was scattered by a storm, and he was found, injured and alone, by the monks of the monastery. The surly githzerai swordmaster, Dumak, took an uncharacteristic interest in the young bird-man and took him on as his apprentice.

His innocence can provide a good contrast to the more jaded members of the monastery, and protecting him might be a way to get on Dumak's good side.",
