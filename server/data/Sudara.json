Growing up in the Trade Ward, he was inspired by the sight of monks and decided at an early age to become one[cite: 129, 130]. After several attempts, he was finally admitted to a monastery[cite: 131]. His early training consisted more of chores than direct lessons, but his training intensified as he got older[cite: 132, 133]. He spent his limited free time in the monastery's library[cite: 133]. His contact with the outside world was minimal and always supervised[cite: 134]. After several years, his parents came to say goodbye as they were departing for Evermeet, leaving a small pouch with the Abbot for Sudara should he ever need it[cite: 135, 136]. As his training progressed, Sudara learned about the connection between the material plane and Shadowfell[cite: 137]. Through studying how light and dark, good and evil are all connected, Sudara decided to follow the Way of Shadow[cite: 138].",
