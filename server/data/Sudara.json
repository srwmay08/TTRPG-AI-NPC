    "backstory": "Sudara was born in Waterdeep to an elven father and a human mother. Growing up in the Trade Ward, he was inspired by the sight of monks and decided at an early age to become one. After several attempts, he was finally admitted to a monastery. His early training consisted more of chores than direct lessons, but his training intensified as he got older. He spent his limited free time in the monastery's library. His contact with the outside world was minimal and always supervised. After several years, his parents came to say goodbye as they were departing for Evermeet, leaving a small pouch with the Abbot for Sudara should he ever need it. As his training progressed, Sudara learned about the connection between the material plane and Shadowfell. Through studying how light and dark, good and evil are all connected, Sudara decided to follow the Way of Shadow.",
