    "backstory": "Cade De la Cour has faint, gnawing memories of a place called Veridian Point and the Valtimeri Bank from long ago. He has giant's blood and once inhaled Niktogauss, which might contribute to his memory issues. He remembers his parents, Adrem and Lyra, and the grand stories they told, including tales of his father's time with the Harpers. However, details about how he lost his family or their whereabouts are clouded, with persistent images of fire and smoke from that traumatic night when he believes he 'joined the giants'. His parents had promised to meet him in Waterdeep, but they never did, forcing him to survive on his own. He found work as a 'runner' for a Niktogauss delivery service in the city. Cade discovered he possessed an odd, untrained affinity for the arcane arts, which manifests with a mysterious black smoke when he casts spells. During one delivery, he was ambushed, but was unexpectedly saved by Havik the Stitch, a goblin sorcerer. Havik took Cade in and became his eccentric mentor.",

His parents failed to meet him in Waterdeep as they had arranged. He survived by working as a Niktogauss runner until he was rescued from an ambush by Havik the Stitch, who subsequently became his mentor.",
