Raised in a forge-temple built on a dwarven ruin within Undermountain, trained in smithing and the sacred duties of Moradin's clerics. He developed a passion for intricate and beautiful metalwork over simple weaponry. He studied dwarven history, particularly the conflicts with Dark Elves, noting their treachery. Though his path seemed laid out as Moradin's Chosen, the specifics of his destiny were vague, and he yearned for greater understanding. The Sonnlinor priests assigned him missionary work in Waterdeep: to spread Moradin's blessings through craftsmanship and trade, aid those in need, and defend against threats. In Waterdeep, his skills led him to be employed by the Crommer house to lead the crafting of ornate ritual bells from precious metals, a task he undertook to honor Moradin and to begin his Masterworks as a journeyman smith. He is a Journeyman Member of The Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths, and a Supervisor and Consultant for The Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths & Metalforgers.",
