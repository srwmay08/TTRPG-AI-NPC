  "backstory": "Mattrim wasn't always called 'Threestrings.' He was once the fourth member of a moderately successful adventuring band called 'The Silver-Tongued Wyverns.' After a particularly harrowing dungeon crawl that involved a gelatinous cube and what he describes as 'some really intense, colorful-smelling moss,' Mattrim decided the high-stress lifestyle wasn't for him. He retired to the docks of Waterdeep, sold most of his gear for a lifetime supply of sandwiches, and broke three strings on his lute during a particularly enthusiastic jam session. He never bothered to replace them, claiming the music 'breathes better' this way.",
  "motivations": [

  ],
  "speech_patterns": "Uses words like 'like,' 'man,' 'whoa,' and 'groovy' constantly. Sentences tend to drift off into thoughtful silence.",
  "mannerisms": "Frequently seen scratching his scruffy chin. Stares into the middle distance as if listening to a song only he can hear. Always seems to be pulling a piece of food out of a pocket.",

    {"name": "“One-Eyed” Jilly", "relationship": "Tavern Owner / Snack Provider", "status": "Alive"}

  "gm_notes": "Mattrim is a fantastic source for rumors, but getting a straight answer is a challenge. He's more likely to accidentally reveal a critical clue while telling a long, rambling story about something else entirely. Offering him food is the best way to keep him talking."
