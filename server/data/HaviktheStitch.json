    "backstory": "Havik, a goblin, was called 'The Stitch' by a silver-haired urchin girl named Wren, whom he took in and cared for. He protected other street children, teaching them survival skills. Wren died in a flophouse fire set by a slumlord; she had gone back for her doll. Havik tried to save her with a wild magic spell he didn't know he could cast, but was too late. He retrieved a glass button eye from the doll, blackened but whole, and stitched it into his cloak over his heart. He has never taken the cloak off since; it's now a patchwork of gifted patches from those he's helped. This tragedy gave his actions and magic new resolve. Later, he encountered Cade De la Cour, who was being ambushed. Havik intervened with a chaotic burst of wild magic, saving Cade. He then took Cade in, and though they bicker, they formed a close, functional bond.",
