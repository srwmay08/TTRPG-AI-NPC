    "character_type": "PC",
    "name": "Havik the Stitch",
    "race": "Goblin",
    "class": "Wild Magic Sorcerer",
    "alignment": "Chaotic Good",
    "age": "Unknown",
    "personality_traits": "Quirky, nerdy, funny, but resolute when determined[cite: 53]. A nervous goblin who fumbles through magic he doesn't fully control[cite: 75]. Bluffs with big words and flourishes not to protect himself, but to project safety for those who look to him[cite: 76]. His eyes twitch and hands shake[cite: 92].",
    "ideals": "Protecting the vulnerable: He took on the responsibility of protecting other urchins because someone had to[cite: 63]. Projecting safety for others through his actions, even if it involves bluffing[cite: 76]. His personal motto: 'Rule Eight: Always pretend you meant it. Even if you didn't. Especially if you didn't.' [cite: 53]",
    "bonds": "The memory of Wren, a young urchin girl he cared for who died in a fire. He stitched a glass button eye from her doll into his cloak above his heart, which serves as a focus for his magic, a compass, a curse, and a promise[cite: 56, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71]. His patchwork cloak, made from gifted patches from urchins he's saved, with each square being a memory and a vow[cite: 72, 73]. His companion Cade De la Cour, whom he mentors and protects[cite: 98, 101, 102, 103].",
    "flaws": "Fumbles through magic he doesn't fully control, leading to chaotic and unpredictable results[cite: 67, 75, 77]. Can be nervous and anxious, with visible tells like twitching eyes and shaking hands[cite: 75, 92]. Initially disliked people depending on him[cite: 61].",
    "backstory": "Havik, a goblin, was called 'The Stitch' by a silver-haired urchin girl named Wren, whom he took in and cared for[cite: 56, 57, 58, 59]. He protected other street children, teaching them survival skills[cite: 62]. Wren died in a flophouse fire set by a slumlord; she had gone back for her doll[cite: 64, 65, 66]. Havik tried to save her with a wild magic spell he didn't know he could cast, but was too late[cite: 67, 68]. He retrieved a glass button eye from the doll, blackened but whole, and stitched it into his cloak over his heart[cite: 69, 70]. He has never taken the cloak off since; it's now a patchwork of gifted patches from those he's helped[cite: 72, 73]. This tragedy gave his actions and magic new resolve[cite: 75, 76]. Later, he encountered Cade De la Cour, who was being ambushed. Havik intervened with a chaotic burst of wild magic, saving Cade[cite: 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. He then took Cade in, and though they bicker, they formed a close, functional bond[cite: 98, 99, 100, 101].",
    "motivations": "To protect the vulnerable, inspired by his past with Wren and the urchins[cite: 62, 76]. To guide and protect Cade De la Cour[cite: 101, 102]. To manage and perhaps understand his chaotic wild magic[cite: 75]. To uphold the promise represented by Wren's button eye[cite: 71].",
    "speech_patterns": "Often mutters[cite: 60, 92]. Can have a coarse voice[cite: 93]. Uses big words and flourishes, especially when bluffing[cite: 76].",
    "mannerisms": "Anxiously fingers the glass button eye stitched into his cloak[cite: 71]. Eyes twitch and hand shakes, especially when nervous or casting spells[cite: 92]. Resettles his spectacles[cite: 95]. Once sneezed before a large magical explosion[cite: 92].",
    "past_situation": "He was a caretaker for a group of urchins in Roangate. A young girl named Wren, who was dear to him, died in a fire he couldn't prevent despite his emerging wild magic[cite: 56, 59, 64, 66, 68]. This event solidified his resolve. Later, he rescued Cade De la Cour from an ambush, and the two became companions[cite: 84, 87, 92, 98].",
    "current_situation": "Traveling with Cade De la Cour, using his unpredictable wild magic to help others and project an image of control, even as he struggles with its chaotic nature[cite: 75, 76, 100]. He acts as a mentor to Cade[cite: 101].",
