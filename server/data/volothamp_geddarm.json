        "introduction": "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence. My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?",
        "about_floon": "Floon? A wonderful fellow! A bit of a dandy, I'll admit. We were enjoying a fine evening at the Skewered Dragon, a tavern of perhaps... questionable repute, but the ale is cheap! I left to meet with another associate, and that's the last I saw of him.",
        "about_the_reward": "Yes, yes, ten gold pieces—dragons, as we call them in the city—for each of you now, for expenses. And one hundred more each upon Floon's safe return! A small price to pay for a friend's life, wouldn't you agree?"
