uh I did get a RAM upgrade well
uh between last session and this session
so hopefully things are smoother for me
whole session long I did a nice reboot
so feeling good about that
um alright
so uh
you were outside the Candle Lane warehouse
you had uh
made your connection with uh
Captain Staget uh
upon rescuing
uh reneer
uh
never remember from under the uh
like fish gut staircase
um
you had slain a uh
crew of Kanku henchmen and uh
caused enough of a stir to uh
attract the local guards but uh
reneer vouched for you on your way out
uh and uh
you've all decided to depart into the evening
uh to take a long rest before you head into the sewers
uh I just wanna know who I
I feel like probably most appropriate is
order in which you would arrive back to
like your establishments uh does that sound fairest
yeah OK
uh so in that case
uh looking at the map
uh you're outside the Candle Lane warehouse
I've done a little bit of color coding on the uh
water deep map I'll uh
push you all over here um
you're at the Candlelight Warehouse
uh the yawning portals up here
but I think probably the closest is the
Golden Horn Gambling House
just up Snail Street
uh so
I feel like Cade and havoc
would be the first to return
all right
all right uh
the day after their sewer delving lead
Cade and havoc returned to the Golden Horn
not with the swagger of heroes
but with the quiet tread of truant employees
the promise of 14,000 gold pieces
has made their security gig feel
infinitesimally small
you have the need to maintain a low profile
and a legitimate source of income remains
your hopes for a quiet shift at the Golden Horn
are dashed the moment you step through the door
Benethan is present with a wiry face
let me set the scene here
you guys are outside the front uh doors
uh you know
returning back uh expecting
expected to work this evening
you haven't been here in some time
it's late in the evening too um
as you enter uh
Bennett Spot
Bennett is like
waiting for you
and spots you as you come in the front door
but he's like there you are
uh he's a
like pretty welcomed human um
but he's like there you are for going
any greeting he's like
fancy seeing you too Grace us with your presence
I suppose the all you can eat buffet sign outside
applies to staff a little too literally
well I mean
can you blame a guy
I'm basically just skin and bone here
guys gotta eat
he's like look man
we're down two whole chickens uh
some rolls uh
look I
I need something
you haven't even been on property for the last two days
what are you do you even work here anymore
just wait till I look over to havoc
just wait till I tell Lynch he's about to like
go into another tirade uh
Kate as you look around havoc
you see this too out of the uh uh
space behind benethan you spot your three urchins
they like dart out and are hiding behind the pillars
uh
the leader of the group is a mute female
she kind of gives you like the
the hand signal that you're accustomed to
but she like rattles a pouch and it
it has the
not the clink of gold but the clang
like the the Tang of like chips of the casino
and immediately you're like
oh this
this is something we're interested in
uh
he benethan is like leaning into you both now and he uh
um
doesn't even notice her approach
but she runs up and she hands Cade you this pouch
and then she dark did did
did it look like she stole it from some place
or did she just like appear with this thing of chips
uh she doesn't
I mean you're not sure at this point
uh OK
but you would imagine that I think Kate
and have it you'd have some understanding
that this girl's worked for you in the past uh
and has helped you you know
keep the eye keep an eye on
extra eye on the place
when you're not here doing other jobs
so and yeah
Bennett was talking about like food
going missing what was he talking about
chicken missing and stuff
oh yeah
he was
he's upset because there's been like chickens missing
and like from the oh
you can eat buffet he's like
I'm unaccounted for chickens like he's like
are you you two are poaching from the
oh is it more likely that these urchins
our urchin friends are poaching here
oh yeah
you kind of yeah yeah
I I took
I took the fall on it
by basically admitting that I did it
even though I didn't I got you
I got you yeah
well played well played Caden
the the coin
you've had enough time to open the pouch
the pouch is a you know
right off the fact Caden
that these are counterfeit chips
she's she's OK
she's handed you a pouch of counterfeit chips
and I think that you put two and two together
they've swiped them from some
would be counterfeiter in the casino
okay um
so she like darted off yeah
she just like
shoved this pouch in her hand and then like
ducked back into the crowd
OK do
do I can I still see her
or is she like completely vanished from my view
she's gone out
I would imagine that she's out of your view
at this point OK
it was like do I see the chips as well
I see I see the same
I can't yeah
I would I would look
I would I would look at them
and then I'd kind of show them to you
now Benathan
Benathan Benathan yeah
clearly just because our bodies are not here
doesn't mean we're not working
young man
see we have uh we've already unearthed uh
something happening just just under your nose and I
and I'm just gonna kind of allude to K
to just flash the chips to kind of
demonstrate that even though our bodies have been gone
we're we're we're still working we're still here yeah
I k
K would kind of catch on to like
to this a little bit slower
and so he's kind of standing there
and when you say like like under your nose
and I kind of stand there
and I kind of notice that you're like
gesturing towards me
and I look down at the chips and look at you and I go
oh uh yeah they're uh counterfeits
someone someone was cheating
benathan stares at a pile of fake chips
his anger momentarily forgotten
it's replaced by the cold dread of a manager
looking at a serious threat to his profit margins
he picks one up from your hands
he's kind of like
rubbing it between his thumb and his finger
uh it's a pretty good deception
and he obviously hasn't noticed them
uh so uh good on you
uh Bennett and glars uh from the chips back to you too
his jaw is tight uh he's still mad but he's like uh
I can't argue a few stolen chickens are an annoyance
counterfeit currency is a crisis
besides Benethan if
you know I mean
if we're always here and and always watching
you know we won't really catch these guys
so every once in a while we
we plan these out you know
this is this is all
this is all part of our part of our process
you have to you have to see yeah
Benethan is like uh
are you taking these to Lynch Chaser or should I
that that's up to you boss
yeah he uh
he grabs the bag from you
he's like
this this is well done
uh I trust we're in good hands till then
and yeah like
can I pocket
can I try to pocket one or two of them quickly
before he takes the whole bag
yeah you guys have had like
you've dispersed them to the
like they were uncounted I
I think that it would be you wanna uh
like how many do you want is the real question
yeah I'll just uh
I just like to palm 2 or 3 of them okay
yeah I don't think uh
you would need to roll against him for that
uh I feel like they were just being handed freely so uh
easily slipped into your pockets
awesome
uh you guys uh
he kind of turns away to uh
head back into the uh restaurant
uh you guys are free to act here as uh
you want I
know that the game is currently paused
yep let's go
hey
we might have to uh
and I and
and I'm just gonna
obviously I assume that Kate's recognize that I
I took a few um more for us
I feel like he wouldn't notice initially
oh okay
his perception is pretty bad
I have a negative one uh oh
I don't really
I don't really pay attention to something
unless if I'm trying to like investigate it
so uh
so I'm gonna take one
and I just very quickly kind of flash it to Cade uh
and I'm just explaining that I have these just to
so that we can keep an eye out
make sure that if we do catch somebody with them
we have some evidence to hold against it
um we should probably uh
make our way to the next uh
for our next steps for the night
yeah I uh
I still can't believe that uh
that we're waiting an entire night
it
I know that if I was kidnapped somewhere in a sewer
I'd hope that whoever was going to save me would
we'd do so immediately but honestly
a night's rest could do some good
so I just
I hope that we're not too late when we get there
well if
if it's too late tonight
it's gonna be or if it's too late tomorrow
it would have likely been too late tonight
there's a storming in headstrong into
into the sewers is never a great idea
I think a little rest a little plan
a little refresh will do us good
well that way we can handle whatever is ahead of us
I I hope by the gods you're right
cause if we're wrong
I feel like it's our fault
but uh yeah I'mma
I'mma head to bed I would check on uh
one of your urgents uh
try to see if you can track down who exactly uh
these came from maybe they're still here
yeah that's what um
if I've got time tonight before we do a full rest
I don't know what the intention is for the next couple
bits here but um
if the urchins are around
I would definitely question them quickly
no
I think it was a good time to go to rest at the house
and okay
the urchins have done their work for the night
you can catch them when you are available next
do the urgents have names
yes Nat
Squidly and Jinks Nat is a human female
she's like the leader of the group
but she's a mute
uh okay
she's she's the mute one
that's what I was wondering
okay uh
squidly is also oh no
squidly is a red tiefling boy
uh and then Jenks is a uh
very portly young black man
okay
um I think uh
Nat was the one that uh
that found him so whenever you see her again
just uh I'll talk with her
yeah I would
uh Cade would start heading to his uh
to his quarters okay
to that little side building yeah
I uh
I don't have that loaded uh
that's fine I don't need to go there
yeah I don't need to go there map wise
OK I'm just gonna go there and yeah
and havoc you're going there as well
are you uh
correct going to do your uh
magic bits just wanted to follow up or we can uh
come back to that if you want
um no
no no
I'll I'll
I'll go ahead and rest okay
alright uh
those two had to rest I would say that it is uh
Roach and uh
Sir Kailyn that returned to the spires of the morning
uh next here uh
uh Sir Cailan returns to the spires of the morning
long after the sun has set
the grand sun drenched halls are now left hushed
and still bathed in soft silver light of the moon
filtering through the high windows
the morning bustle of priests serving the needy
has given way to a profound
holy quiet
broken only by the echo of his own armored footsteps
he makes his way up the three flights of stairs
to the main chapel
a vast chamber where the altar of lathander stands
a single tall votive candle has been left burning
its solitary flame
a beacon of the immense shadowed space
Sir Kailyn will approach uh
the altar uh
still with his armament on and his shield on his back
he will take a kneeling position in front of the candle
and the altar
ah at that moment
the flame of the lone candle suddenly flares
it does not sputter or flick
but grows into a brilliant
steady globe of golden light
momentarily pushing back the shadows of the furthest
corners of the chapel for a breathtaking moment
the light takes on a distinct
radiant shape of a Sunburst
leaving the emblem of the morning Lord himself
just as quickly as it returns to its normal
gentle flicker warm after Cailen's vision
Caleb bows his head and starts a lengthy prayer
um adjusting and
and starting to think about his journey thus far
uh starting with his parents
his birth
and now
coming into this crew that is now come together
and the good that they have already done
in the matter of a couple days
he will begin to
start to reflect directly to the morning Lord
how this path seems to be the correct path and uh
really kind of
address how he's feeling about the last few days
as your uh
final words echo into holy silence
the brilliant flame of the candle does not flicker
and fade
it extinguishes itself into a gentle wisp of smoke
plunging the chapel into expected darkness
but the darkness does not last
from the grand stained window behind the altar
a window that should be showing only the black of night
a soft golden light bleeds through
it grows steadily as the sun itself were rising
hours ahead of time just for him
the impossible dawn casts a long
gentle ray across the chapel floor
bathing Cailen in its warm hopeful light
he feels no heat only a profound peace
of the absolute certainty of his purpose
uh you're gonna get a bonus to um
when you cast your light cantrip
uh
you will be able to uh
essentially dispel darkness if it's of a certain level
and I will reveal that to you
obviously more as you use it
but just for use now if you use light cantrip
just that is uh
a benefit that uh
Justin has been bestowed upon you
Aiden will look up the light
in understanding and immediately use that new benefit
and staring at the light
he will feel compelled to take an oath
directly for the Dawn Father in which he says
oh dawn father hear my vow
let it be etched into soul and steel
I swear before the morning Lord and all rising light
when faced with evil I will strike at the greater
let no horror go unchallenged
while lesser shadows distract my aim
I will show no mercy to the wicked
let those who defile life and mock the dawn
meet only my steel
I will not be stayed by fear or doubt
if the path to justice is hard or unclear still
I will walk it
and when I fail to stop them
I will mend what they break
the harm they sow is mine to set right
this is my oath this is my charge
by Dawn's Grace I will not turn away
yeah the uh
warmth of lathander kind of fills you in this moment
uh and you feel like
truly connected to the oath that you've just uh
stated forth uh
uh his path forward may be uh
uh
fraught with shadows but here in the temple uh
he is filled with the unwavering promise of the dawn
that you are sworn to bring now
Caleon will salute uh
his god and then rise and turn to leave
yeah uh
and then you will
proceed down the stairs to your
dormitory to take your long rest
uh alright
uh next would be uh
Mora returning to the forge dormitory
I cannot switch scenes until things finish loading
I tried to preload everything I'm sorry
let me know when you uh
have it here
I can start a little bit and then you can move in
in scene
uh the descent
into the temple is a welcome return to your senses
the lingering fish
scented air of the dock ward
is replaced by the comforting
sacred smell of stone soot and hot metal
the forges are baked for the night
their thunderous roar reduced to a gentle sleeping hum
but a deep primal warmth still radiates from the stone
greeting him like an old friend
standing near the main anvil
a silhouette against the forge's dying glow
is Borin Stonehammer
the old family guard turns to Moro as he approaches
the single eye in his withered face
filled with profound respect
Master Moro Borin says
you've returned the mistress and master are resting
finally they're shaken but whole
they asked me to express their deepest thanks
hi
it was quite hairy and I'm sure
yeah uh
he nods assuringly uh
Young Kaidou was grateful too
he was overjoyed to see his parents
after two days apart
you have a knack for bringing relief to that boy's face
he says he gestures to follow you into the kitchen
uh he's like uh
Burgo's down here Burgo is the uh
Crowmer's personal chef Burgo
you can smell
as soon as he opens the door to the kitchen
that he's been preparing multiple
like main lavish dwarven feasts
so uh
you can imagine that you're gonna be well fed and
uh taken care of just by opening the door
uh
Burgo's uh
hard at work on the kitchen but uh
on the table is already a simple meal
of some smoked sausages some cheeses
two tankards of dark ale uh
and uh
boring gestures for you to sit down at the table
oh thank you
this is nice this is quite nice
give me one of them there sausages
yeah you're just like digging in
uh but uh
Borin is like your
your place is secure here in this household
uh
I'd like to offer you you know
any additional work that comes our way
uh a man of your uh
capabilities and standing
I think uh
could uh
benefit from uh
some extra work the Cromers might be interested in uh
having done here and there
uh uh
you know uh
one of the main uh
uh sources of income is the piping
uh here in water deep and uh
I uh
have understood uh
through the Grapevine that you have uh
taken a contract and are searching for a kidnapped man
uh
the sewers are always in need of repair and Protection
uh protect the crammer's interest
uh we would be certainly willing to pay you for that uh
but for work you've already done uh
Duff asked me to give you this and he uh
it's like uh jet
uh like produces from his uh
inventory a uh
like wrapped vellum scroll
it's like uh
as he sets it down
you probably tell it's like some type of worm hide
uh it's ancient looking uh
there's a seal on it and uh
the seal looks like Duff Crammer's the third's
but it's really Duff Crammer the first's
and it takes you a moment
but you recognize it as uh such
uh and he slides this across the table to you and uh
as you're looking at this Parchment
you kind of uh
tell me your reaction here
with the utmost care immediately
sensing the gravity of such an ancient writing
in your like majesty I in reverence you're like
my thought I didn't want to interrupt you
but he like clangs down on the table
a ingot and the
sound is different than anything you've heard recently
uh
your thought immediately interrupted as you look down
and he slides across this like silvery
purply blue ingot and he slowly pulls his hands away
and takes his hands off the
can't speak
leans back and grabs his beer
and just
gets really comfortable through your reaction here
and just starts like a long
slow drink
to hear whatever is gonna come out of your mouth next
is that silver really blue
it can't be tell me that's not the
tell me that's not the metal
I think it is hi it is
well that be methro
it is
where did you get your hands on a whole ingot of it
the crammers have deep connections
there's more of this to be found then aye
there's more to be paid in
oh
Miss Will
would make the perfect masterwork for my master class
hmm
yes
and this scroll here
I start to glance at it a little bit very reverently
he's just giggling
waiting for you to open it up because he
I I think at this point you know
he he respects you and your smithing capabilities uh
I mean he knows what you're capable of
so this isn't something
that the Cromers would give lightly
but like he
you get the sense that you accept these things you
you have to come into the fold of the Cromers and like
do the do some lifting here for him now
by the forge father's anvil
this is the ways to work it the right ways
Muradin's ways
die
so they will stay true to the forge father
then if that's fair and clear
they will honor the forge father
then I will honor the house of the crammer
my service for Morden and the Cromer
yeah they uh
he stands up and toasts for Morden and the cromers
and he reaches out to clang your Stein
I think it drink it carefully
holding away the vellum scroll as far as possible
in a tight grip yeah
not letting go he's
he respects it he's like
Burgo you done man
this boy needs to eat
he's been up to some good work for us
and he uh
grabs Burgo by the shoulder and you have like a
a smorgasbord of like
dwarven favorites on the counter in the kitchen here
uh there's a whole tankard of ale
uh and uh yeah
you are uh boring
and Burgo make their way out
he's like well I'll be in touch boy
thank you again
tell Duff and his lovely wife and their boy
I am glad to be here
and I am very glad that they are well
um I'll uh
link that scroll for everybody to read here
just a moment
if uh you want to
do you want you're boss
alright here you go
if you uh wanna read for a bit
sorry alright uh
so that's everybody up to long rest minus Sudara
uh he said he would be here about 7:30
and I feel like I am right on time for him to arrive
at any moment um
I'll give you a free roleplay
does anybody else want to follow up
anything in their scenes uh
or uh
engage in uh
before you decide you're going to meet up again
I just assumed you would all be meeting up
somewhere around the candlelight warehouse
and going
sewer diving in the early mornings right
yeah I just have the uh
wake up scene with uh Bishop
but yeah no
nothing else besides that
okay
Kailyn okay
sorry
Kailyn would see if the High Radiance
or the High Dawn Knight is still currently around
yeah uh
I definitely think we could uh
make that happen uh
havoc and Cade had something they were uh
gonna work out uh
let's let them do there a bit and I
I will uh
prepare a little bit for the high radiance
okay
awesome
so Kate I
I think that would probably lead to you right
so we're yup
we're both
we're both crashed we're both
so I I assume you woke up first like you usually do
correct okay
yeah so
so usually so I'd probably be up um
just maybe tinkering with my cloak
checking the stitches
just making things are good to go on it and uh
considering the day and
and what we need to prepare for
to be able to go down in the sewer
so I'm just kind of ticking off random rules in my head
and uh
possibly out loud as well as I as
as you're sleeping
yeah uh
as you're like working
you all of a sudden kind of hear
like kind of scuttling upstairs and like
almost like a thud like I fell out of bed
and you just hear coming from upstairs
stitch stitch you
you gotta see this and I come running down
kind of running down the stairs
and you see I'm still in kind of like my
my sleeping clothes just like a basic white
kind of like villager shirt with some rolled up pants
but in my hand I'm holding a
a black like trans not translucent
but like a black like dagger
kind of that looks like
it's made out of that same kind of black smoke
that had that you had seen previously
and around my right arm is like
that black smoke just wrapped around
kind of going up to like my
like my armpit where it seems like that's like
where the smoke is kind of like emanating from
but I'm holding this this dagger in my hand
I'm like I finally figured it out
wow my boy
go ahead figure figure what out
sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you
no no
it's fine uh
and he's like I
I think I figured out how to make physical illusions
like you told me about you know
that one time that you made that elephant appear
in the lobby oh yeah
totally on purpose yeah
that was to scare that guy off
that was my intent yes
I think I figured it out it's
it looks a little different than yours
but I mean
I can like hold it and it like feels like it has weight
but it like doesn't
hmm
uh
have I seen I'm wondering if I would have seen this uh
looking around the room what are
did you say we're kind of in the kitchen area
or we're in your room I can't remember where you no
we're like we're like downstairs where I had like
eaten breakfast at the first session when I woke up
but like there's that
that table
so I I would probably look for something like a
like if
if we're oh
there we are okay cool
if we're in that area
I'd look for something like an apple or something
I'm gonna toss it towards you to see if maybe it cuts
cause I'm I'm
I'm curious about it as
as I've explained before obviously I'm a uh
I'm a sorcerer so my magic is
is more native so I don't have all the full control
and of course somebody's at my door
so give me two seconds I'm listening
go ahead Kate
yeah if you like threw the apple up at me
um
Kade would actually kind of like track it
and then throw the knife from his hand
to the to the apple
and if you need me to roll an attack roll
I can but if not
I just thematically I would hit it
uh DM
that's okay yeah
that's fine yeah
um he
he throws it
and the knife kind of goes directly through the apple
and it doesn't seem to cut it at all
um and it kind of like
hits the wall and disperses into nothing
and the apple kind of clinks to the ground
and Kate kind of looks at that and goes dang it
huh
how plenty of use is still my son
it doesn't do anything
and then I pick up the apple off the ground
and I take a bite and immediately spit it out
as the internal
the inside of the apple is completely rotted now
kind of like in a line from where my dagger had
like pierced it I'm like
I think it did do something just uh
not to the outside of the apple
and I kind of show them the inside
and it's like this almost like necrotic looking
rotted apple on the inside
I mean it's no elephant in the uh
in the hallway but this could be useful
this could be useful and uh
is it can you just can you make as many as you
as you want at any time do you feel anything
what is what's bringing this about
I don't know what what's bringing it about
but I think I could make make more uh
and I kind of kind of like set myself
and then in both of my hands
these daggers appear again
and then as I like kind of open my hand up
they just vanish
and then I close my hands again and they appear
and then like I kind of do it over and over again
I'm like yeah
I mean it's like it's almost like blinking um
I also feel like I could
and I kind of look at havoc and I kind of concentrate
and I'm going to I'm gonna use up one of my chargers
I'm gonna use um
uh psychic whispers okay
and then I gotta
I gotta roll a D6 and that is how long um
how many hours I can have a telepathic link to somebody
okay and I'm just gonna do
use one of my psychic points just for
for him
so for three hours I can talk with you telepathically
so like I kind of look at you
and all of a sudden you hear my voice in your head
hey uh is this working
and you can respond in you can respond uh
in your head to me as well
havoc is going to instantly jump out of his skin um
and kind of quickly look around and be like
well child
I'm not sure what this has to do with those blades
but hmm hold hold on hold on
let me try this and
and he's gonna respond back through the link
yes how uh
how is this how is this
it works perfectly I
I honestly I think that the genie
might have had some sort of effect in I
I mean regardless
it seems like I can uh
I have a little bit more control over magic now
I think we can kind of take the uh
the lessons uh a little bit more seriously
well I think it's time we should
we should maybe take these newfound powers to
and put them to good use in the sewers
let's go find our pals from the night before yeah
let let me go get changed real quick
and as I kind of run upstairs
you hear Kate say through his mind again
he says I don't even need to bring my rapier anymore
and then he gets changed and then he'll
he'll go and meet everybody else wherever we meet nice
alright let's come back to uh Sir Kailyn uh
at the spires of the morning uh
you're up before even like the uh
chefs and uh patrons have come for early breakfast
but it's an unusual day
there's not often two dawns seen on water deep
and though this may not have been visible to
everybody in the city
it's recognized that
you know like as uh
you make your way through there
you know the few people that are active in the temple
uh stop a moment and uh
you just seem to like you're warm uh glowing
uh the uh
radiance is uh
through the kitchen there to the right
and then down the hall
hey uh
Caitlin will just solemnly walk and greet those as he
as he passes yeah
and then enter her chamber
she's like uh
come in come in
Sir Cailin uh
the holy magic of this temple sings and she continues
her voice is calm uh
this morning it sang a hymn of brilliance
I have not heard in several years
seems the morning Lord indeed
Grace you with a personal sunrise
tell me what did you see in his life
the dawn
the dawn brings new joy I've sworn my oath
ah it is as I thought
the heat that forge uh
the heat of the forge shapes the steel
and the heat of the purpose shapes the soul
this is the path of the morning Lord
yes a new beginning has sprung
ah
she's like a an oath is not a cage
Sir Cailan is not a list of rules meant to bind you
think of it as a lens
ah the truest oath comes from the soul
forged in the fires you have endured
you feel it do you not
a new strength in your arm
a new certainty in your heart
that is the fire of your oath already taking root
I will do my best to hold
my decisions and disciplines to it yeah
uh as you uh
uh uh engage her uh
she bows uh with a uh profound respect for you uh
she says uh lathander hears you Sir Kailyn
you bows in return um
high radiance I have a request if possible
oh a request certainly something we can provide
so we speak of new beginnings uh
I have joined a small group
and I wish to prioritize tasks
and ongoing with this group
well
the Dawn Father has spoken to you directly
if you feel this is the best use of your time
with the resources of the order
you are a
rising champion to our cause
uh lathander uh boots that you seek out enemies of uh
the dawn and the day char
uh anywhere night uh creeps into uh people's souls
uh you should be there if this is uh
the road that you uh will be going down
I I in the order and the spires will support you
is there anything that you need immediately
yes and that's that's partly why I've come to you now
um this group
this band of companions
is about to go down into the sewers of water deep
um you
as well as any likely
know that there are horrors of the dark down there
do we have anything
in our archives or our personal libraries
that would help us navigate through the sores
or any
any sorts of intelligence that might help us at all
uh yeah
I mean I
I think that you would have uh
probably some layers of understanding of like
the underworld going on in the sewers like uh
Shar is a agent in uh Skullport right
there are Shar worshippers that uh
lathander and the spires of the morning directly oppose
so uh
hearing that you're going underground
is not really a surprise uh
you know uh
it's most customary to go with like other templars
but if you feel you've have a crew that can back you
I think that's like the the right way to go
uh do you want to roll for like general history of that
and maybe I'll give you some advantages down
when you get into the sewer
yeah like histories or any kind of architect plans that
um past paladins or um
clerics may have come across while
I don't know
fighting something down there or chasing after
anything of that sort whatever you want me to roll
uh yeah
let's do some uh
let's do some history let's uh
let's do history right now
alright so I'll roll history
not great at history but let's see what happens
nope that's a 4
oh yeah
do any of us have a oh
we're not with him anyways
never mind uh
yeah I
I think that you'd like I said
you'd have like general understanding a 4 is not like a
uh definitely gonna get you like
the guidebook to the sewers here this evening
uh yeah
but uh
you know I
I'm gonna give you a the benefit at uh
one twist or turn that you'll figure out where
where exactly you are okay
okay sounds good
all right uh
still no Sudara so uh
I'd say we're just gonna keep moving forward
you've all met up now out
uh outside the Candle Lane warehouse uh
let me pop this up here
I actually I'm not even gonna pop up that uh
are you planning on going down into the sewers
uh
did you uh
let reneer know you were like
meeting up at a specific time
he would have an interest in going with you
he was a little chuffed
probably that you didn't go down right away
but I mean relented and understood that like
a full rest makes sense in
in any sewer delving situation
so I think he would have been in the same vein as Cade
but he'd be interested in going with you
if you would accept him
I would say let's accept him
but on the basis that he mostly stays
at archer range
if he can contribute as an archer or like
you know with the
with the sorcerers in the back
that would be great
I was gonna ask if he was even like
did
if he looked like a combatant when we like rescued him
oh yeah he
I mean he looks like a pretty stout fellow
uh you know uh
he's the son of a noble uh
the open Lord of water deep for a period of time
he definitely would have gone through like uh
sword training tutelage
uh I mean
this is just general knowledge you'd have of nobles
um yeah
but yeah I mean
he's definitely seems able bodied
uh you know uh
would be willing to go
I don't think you would take that lightly
I I agree with everything that uh
Caitlin said
okay
uh
alright so prepare the Ford supplies
you'll need them I'm sure
uh go ahead and I'll hand it
but whoever is big bag uh
leading the charge here uh
go ahead and make a uh
survival check for me you're tracking this uh
group of kidnappers to a nearby sewer
to the candlelight warehouse
uh I think it makes sense
let's actually look at the big map of water deep here
I'm gonna go back to this
uh I recommend you turn on your journal notes here
and then uh
Candle Lane Warehouse we're like over here somewhere
right Candle Lane
yep
alright uh
so
uh go ahead and who's
who's uh leading the survival uh
search for following the clues as to where you went
tavik is definitely not a leader of the charge
he's he's more of a hang out around the ankles
and look around nervously
so he's not leading
Kate would definitely like lean onto Kalin to
to lead
as he seems to have the most authority in general
okay um
my background actually intervene here as an urgent
and I'm also an urchin so
I didn't know if that would give me a background of a
of city secrets yeah
I passages and such
I think both of these would come into play
is there I'm sorry
any specifics to those that you think would apply best
just the feature is either the ground
I can link it if you don't have it
I think mine is also city secret
so you know
the secret patterns and flow to cities
and can find passages
through urban sprawl that others would miss
when you're not in combat
you and companions
you lead can travel between any two locations
in the city twice as fast nice
yeah you are in frequent contact with people
in the segment of society that your chosen course
move through
these people might be associated with criminal
underworld or the rough and tumble folk of the streets
or members of high society
this connection comes in the form of a contact
in any city you visit
a person who provides
information about the people and places
of the local area alright
sweet I think I think I think all of our good oh sorry
I'm just saying like combined
I I feel like this definitely would lead
you to the right sewer locations that you go down
Caleb you were so gonna say
what's your background to
just hit me with all of it
so that I have it fresh in mind
yeah I have access to secret networks secret signs
passwords and assistance in finding information okay
um
but honestly
like with all three features of our backgrounds
I think we could pretty much find it like you said
yeah uh alright
I I think you can find the sewers uh
you know obviously
I want to roleplay
like passwords and that type of thing
so I want you to consider that uh
you know you might not know all the passwords
but you I'm gonna let you get into some of them
on a lucky guess kind of thing uh
but uh yeah uh
it's uh reneer shows up uh
just after you know you know your meeting time
he's uh like ready to go he's got a rapier in his hand
he's got a little like fencing shield uh
you know uh
it is like Butler yeah
it's like a little tiny buckler uh
and he
you know is in like a decent set of leather armor um
but he's like alright
alright boys
let's go and he follows you down to the sewers um
the air uh changes the moment you descend
the crisp clean scent of the night you just left
or sorry the day
the day you just left here in
the dock ward is replaced by the physical presence
in the air a thick
wet ancient stench that coats the back of your throat
it's a smell that a thousand things forgotten
of rot and waste
and the deep and damp places of the earth
the stone walls of the tunnel are not merely wet uh
they are slick with a greasy
greenish
black slime that seems to writhe in the torchlight
your boots make a sickening slurp with each step
the only noise beside the endless
echoing symphony of drips uh
that patter from unseen cracks in the ceiling uh
you are intruders here back in the gullet of the city
and every shadow seems to cling to you
a cold and unwelcome embrace
uh so you are now in
you've climbed down a like sewer stair like ladder um
nearby to the warehouse
you'd think this is the most uh appropriate oh sorry
wrong wrong scene
this is the one you should be on
let me drop reneer in
I'm gonna pause for just a moment
near goes here
who cannot see in the dark me
okay um
does Cade wear anything
clothing I mean I have like clothes on um
I don't really have
now that I don't have like my weapons on me
I'm literally just like I'm just wearing clothes
I I don't have like
anything else I'm wearing an eye patch I guess
okay um
I'm gonna cast light for you
how about that
and put it on a article of clothing or whatever you
whatever you have you know what
actually I think Kate would take his eye patch off
at this point
if you wanted to just cast light on my eye
like my blue eye in theory
it should kind of glow anyway
but I don't have my level of wizard yet
so I don't have the light cantrip myself
um but yeah
if you just wanted to cast it on the eye
then my eye would glow like a headlight
alright good to go
yeah I'm gonna just cast that for you cool
alright
I basically have like a headlamp on my eye that I'm
scanning with yeah
they say my magic is chaos
interesting yeah
you see Caitlin just kind of wave two fingers uh
and then uh
cast light for Cade okay
and golden light explodes
well not explodes
but gently appears
alright
so you're so good
uh Kalin
Havoc and Cade would get the effect of bless
from our guidance sorry
okay wait
there's your plus one
uh I think we decided uh
we're we're gonna let whoever wants roll uh
cause oh
it's a that's right
it's on the receiver to roll
uh
alright I'm gonna let everybody reroll that one hahaha
I'll probably gonna last a minute
can I can I roll when I use it
well I'll tell you what you see here
because you might need it here in the next minute
uh the narrow tunnel opens before you
widening into a small
circular junction of mortared stone
the architect architecture is old but solid
coated in the same layer of filth that covers
everything the path splits here
cleaving two identical
black mod tunnels on your left and on your right
each
promising a deeper descent into this foul labyrinth
your light seems to be swallowed up by their depths
but you've just illuminated this uh
you see it
hanging in the deep shadow beneath the ladder's rungs
a sphere of flesh floats in perfect stillness
uh it's no larger than a halfling's head
its skin is mottled veined
riddled purple its massive central eye
a hypnotizing violet orb
swivels to fix upon your party with an unblinking
alien intelligence
four smaller eye stalks like aberrant
twitching fingers weave slowly through the air
their own tiny eyes
blinking out of sync with each other
it says nothing but you hear a voice
it doesn't come from the creature itself
but it seems to be part of the very sound of the sewer
a soft wet whisper that echoes in the falling water
drip the voice is a perfect memory mimicry of the water
drop drip drip
the central eyes narrow slightly
one of the smaller stalks coils and uncoils
like a serpent comes and goes
the whisper continues a sibilant liquid sound
for it slides around the chamber
comes and goes comes and goes
I decide drip
drip I decide who comes
and goes another drop falls from above
and the voices capture the sound perfectly
I decide who comes and goes drip
who stays and rots drip
drip comes and goes
stays and rots comes and goes drip
the creature floats forward just an inch
its eye stalks writhing and barely contained energy
what do you do uh
the game is paused yep
currently do we see him
yeah
it's literally that was that little tiny thing
yep
alright hmm
he's still going have it drip have drip
I just want to make sure
it's not remnants from the night before guys
but we see this yeah
yeah it is some sort of drippy creature
it's a terrible song should we uh
should we just go back up
is this guy do we really
uh uh
do uh
alright reneer
stop looking at me like that and uh
I'll just start kind of moving forward
maybe I can't I can't select my guy
oh uh
there we go I got it now
it was me yep
um
how close are you so getting
uh I don't wanna get too close before I cast
um if you go one step further this
it will change don't go
don't go there you go
alright don't go yet
I I would like to cast shield on myself
okay you could you may do that
I think that should work
and then I should be able to do this uh
is that right
shield or mage armor cause shield only lasts 4 no
no turn yeah
I think you want mage armor
I do want mage armor yeah
shield's the reaction yeah um
Mora and Kalin uh
you guys just hear this creature comes and goes
comes and goes I decide who come drip drip
it waits the entire being silent
it's it's like
you like hear this just like sound emanating from it
uh and now like is aggressive
it says comes and goes
password comes and goes password comes and goes
password to you too
uh password well haha yeah
uh both of those are wrong
uh this thing immediately attacks you
uh you can roll for initiative
haha I was gonna back up
you guys you guys answered that really quick
pass oh no
almost an at 20 when on that one
I think that I cast that but it's not sure alright
I will just yeah
it looks so good looks like I used a resource there
two not ones on initiative
oh nice
alright looks like we're just missing Sudara and Ranier
I'm gonna add them
comes and goes comes and goes
alright uh havoc
uh this thing uh
has just demanded the password
uh
wealth uh
what was it wealth and password were blurred it out
and it just says wrong and uh
immediately like begins lurching forward
as though it's going to fly at you
it's it's hovering in the air
it's like uh
it's the the sewers
themselves are like 10 feet in height
so it's like up against almost the ceiling
uh almost out of reach
does it look like I mean
do I believe that
this is just the one and only one of these things
do I know like you I mean from where you are
yeah that's
it's the only one I hear right
I just hear that great
yeah alright
uh my first reaction is going to be a huge overreaction
so I'm gonna go chaos Bolt okay
um fireball
yeah yeah
alright hold on
let's make sure I don't chaos ball myself here
I asked how big the room was
I said I cast fireball
I didn't ask if my allies were in range
I asked did they pass the saving throw
alright uh
okay attack
why is it not rolling it there we go
shit 15
uh 15 does hit
alright and then I roll damage
oh nice
alright 11
and then I guess
do I have to roll for what type of damage
yeah uh
does that matter let's see
I don't think he has any particular resistances
so no it's not gonna change
it doesn't matter okay
then it doesn't matter yeah
alright do you uh move
alright um
and then yeah
I'm gonna take I am gonna take some steps forward
I'm gonna sit kind of behind Kalin here
yeah that takes my action
and I think I'm gonna say
you're in full cover behind Sir Kailyn
cause he's larger than me
OK perfect
I imagine shield out like Breach Team
yep OK
am I in full cover behind the door
you're a bit you're a bit taller than he is
you're in you're in the half
if you crouch real good yeah
if you crouch real good
yeah and then I'm just gonna yeah
I'm just gonna crouch and kind of stay there okay
and in my turn okay
uh I'm sorry I didn't begin combat
let me uh
let me go to there we go
okay here we go alright
um
so it is taking damage yes
it is uh
what was the flavor of your Bolt
uh it didn't
it didn't pick well
we didn't pick but let me roll
it's based on damage is it not
I think it's based on your first d 6 roll or
oh okay
oh that's how it goes
you're right so it was a
so it was a 6 so poison poison
oh right
yeah
this thing is probably cool
riding from the poison but it's like just an eye
like a floating eyeball with multiple eyeballs
yeah it is going to
I can't make save yes
haha a wisdom saving throw for me
I cast make I cast make save
that is a fail you do damage
I can't damage
no oh
that sucks it really does
but oh
well
that that is this
that yeah
damage is damage this thing is uh
still floating but ever so barely it is like uh
racked and poisoned and uh
wrecked by the spell that you just uh
cast upon it it is uh Sudara's turn to act
uh he was very heavy in use of his hand crossbow
uh last uh session
so I'm just gonna suspect that he'll oh
actually it looks like he's short bow
uh we're gonna do a normal short bow attack
oh yeah he hits this thing square
uh alright
wow Sudara from the back of the pack
I would think he would step
like one foot out into the channel here and pull his uh
short bow back like squat and uh
take a nice stance and then just like
kind of like arcing
rising shot pins this thing to the wall
uh it
it doesn't like die in a normal manner
it it definitely like
rides itself to death on the arrow for a moment
but it doesn't leave any like tangible corpse
it just kind of like
dissipates as though a dream had ended
there's a there's probably gonna be more of them
I can't and we should probably sit here for a second
to make sure that we funnel them correctly
it's a logical tactic yeah
how how long do you wait here
maybe a minute yeah
I'd say Cade would probably only wait a minute
before he would get antsy
and try to do something alright
uh so all minute spells have worn off at this point uh
you proceed forward into the y of the sewers
and light should still be on Cade
it's I think it got met
placed on the ground instead of his token yeah
I think that I can uh
move that around for you though
no problem
we're gonna say it's here
and I'll just keep moving it with you as you move okay
yeah alright
yep uh
we're still in combat it says yep
sorry let me end combat here
but um
sweet I have a stupid question for so uh
with the mage armor I've cast it on myself
I just mentally keep up that it's my dexterity which is
16+ or no is 13 + 3 because dexterity
it doesn't change it once I cast it right yeah
let's go back and reread
no your AC should be um yeah
when you cast it
it won't update on Foundry automatically
you'll have to like manually
like change it with the modifier
or just remember that the number is different
uh yeah
so you uh
proceed down the to the y of the sewer um
if you can recall the uh
Kanku had uh
mentioned a very specific uh
pattern that you're looking for uh
to uh
determine if you're on the right path uh
I need to know if you're going down the right path
or the left path
and this is definitely gonna require a roll uh
so Kailyn I'm definitely uh
this is the like first one that you come to
I don't think that
this is the one that you'll benefit from most
so I'm gonna say
if you guys wanna search around for a bit
you may have a higher percentage chance of
choosing the right direction
but if you are just going based off gut
no alright
uh hey uh
all the yellow signs yeah
let me let me take a
let me take a peek down the left side
I'll walk it a bit I'll stay
stay hidden I see any yellow markings
I'll I'll come back um
and then if it's not the left
then it's gotta be the right yeah
I'm gonna yeah
actually can I
can I kind of go stealth and
and do the same
maybe just creep along the this side here
uh yep
I remember you're
you're stealthy until you're not until that moment
correct you're not
that's what I remember uh
you're you're fine to move along here
uh everybody that's searching down the hallways uh
please make a perception check roll for me perception
would it would it would investigation also work
yeah I'll take investigation that makes me happy
don't matter for me
I I
I'll let you roll any any skills that you feel survival
I'll take at this point too
I got a 19 okay
yeah uh
Kade uh
you feel that you've sufficiently searched this hall up
up and down you are uh
confident that you don't see any signs
of uh
OK the yellow 10 spoke wheel
yeah uh
havoc has made it halfway down
um
before realizing that he has schmutz in his eye and uh
has to return
yeah
it's definitely not the left
I searched the entire thing
it uh
it ends so you can't even go down anymore
it's gotta be the right side
did you see anything stitch
well the things I saw
things I saw no interpretation of what the things mean
though probably a better was it yellow
yeah I
I would say what did you saw something yellow
but it
like the 10 spoke wheel is maybe not complete or like
it's only like a partial and you're like not certain
okay uh Kate
as soon as he mentions that you
you can look and see uh
uh
you know you see the distinct signs here
like obviously this is an old symbol
but you pick up on the trail right away
the right path is the right way to go
yeah it's a
it's definitely the right side
and we should go that way
alright as to the right as you uh
proceed down the uh sewers ever further
uh
let me go here
uh the tunnel you've chosen transforms
the narrow walkway that you've been walking on
disappears it plunges you into a wide sluggish channel
you're like ankle deep in water
it's not merely murky but it's like this opaque brown
green slurry that fills the passage from wall to wall
uh the surface is kind of filthy
motes of indeterminate waste
greasy slicks have run off
pale floating
things that you try not to look at too closely uh
the only sign of movement is the slow
nauseating burst of the methane
bubbles that rise from the unseen depths
and pop as the wave of the sewer kind of passes by you
uh you need to tell me what order you're in because the
the tunnel narrows to a 5 foot wide passage here
I would say Kalin first Moira 2nd then havoc then Cade
right
I would say sandwich
um yeah
I would I would probably be behind havoc
yeah okay
yeah let me I would say sandwich okay
Callum Havoc more um
in that case if we're sandwich
if we're sandwich k uh
K would probably want to be more close to the front
um and have to have it closer back for like safety
alright so Mora at the back then for Sandwich
Havoc and Cade in the middle
and Sudara near at the very rear
unless you have a different
there's no sir Caitlin no
that's what I yup
nope that's fine for me OK
I'm just excellent
everybody down and then I'm gonna change the scene here
so uh my order that I understand is gonna be uh Caitlin
Cade Havoc Mora
Sudara Renier
that's the order that we're in right
yep okay
yep okay
uh let me just set Renier out to
uh pop
alright here we go
I'm just ooh just gonna pause it for a moment
so you can take in what you see here um
whole bunch of nut but you see nut
hello guys this is uh
this is sure shaping up to be a real nice looking spot
so the the tunnel uh opens up about uh 20 feet
30 feet ahead of you uh
the only way that you can see forward
is to commit yourself to the uh
septic soup straight ahead uh
it does look like there are some passages
here and there on the left and right uh
but uh I'm gonna unpause and let you approach here
okay so just want to be clear if you go past this
this line you will be swimming in water
there is like Kalin as you approach
you kind of see that the uh
like the water is dropping off this
edge a little bit into a like a deeper pool here uh
and flows downward
alright
crap okay um
I'm just gonna kind of
lean around the corner and see what I can see yeah
uh so as you would I be able to squeeze past him
not yet here uh OK
uh which way are you leaning Caleb
up or down um
probably down at first so I would look alright
let me like I'm gonna to the south
I'm gonna just move you here
nothing will happen to you moving there
and I'm gonna give Cade that space just uh
before anybody else moves uh
I can only in my way as well
okay uh
pause pause here for a moment
uh Caleb
you uh
approach a uh
there's a solid metal door and uh
in this uh
door there's a very heavy bolt uh
but it as you're looking at the bolt
you realize it's not just one bolt
there's like three bolts there's uh
one in the middle one at the top and the bottom uh
the door is closed
but the bolts are unlocked at the moment
and it's OK catches your eye
cause the the bolts are on the outside of the door
so obviously locking something in here potentially
I see um
do I see any yellow signage or anything uh
you don't see any yellow signage here
just over a cursory glance
if you wanna take a moment to investigate or uh
you wanna use your history here
I'll let you use
you can roll with advantage on your history here
all right um Kate
let's do that as you're rolling here Roach uh
uh I just rolled
okay sweet
no that's fine
uh Kate
as you step into the other room
uh it looks like
you know maybe some
something has been set up here
but whatever's been set up here
looks like it could be taken down
and moved kind of quickly
if needed like
it looks like you know
there's uh
like a
a carpet on the floor but it looks like
you know
there was obviously some furniture on the carpet uh
but there isn't anything
that would let you believe that there's been presence
recently here
um okay
yeah yeah
uh yeah
you're uh 15 on the uh
history check uh
your mind uh
races through like the books that you've read in the uh
spires of the Morning Sir Cailin
and uh
uh I think that maybe uh
something would stand out as a uh
this would probably be like
reminiscent to a chamber that you've heard of
used when a uh
Ware person is potentially uh
changing
uh just based on like the shape and uh
like uh
distinction of the door there's a
there's a known were
rat population hiding in the sewers of water deep uh
and you think you just found
uh like based on uh
just this quick look around
uh
maybe some somewhere rat activity
uh potentially taking place here
hey then we'll relay that to the squad
and tread carefully
yeah the door is unlocked
uh it
it just is like hanging on the hinges there as you uh
move to it
I kind of tap up Moira on the
on the shoulder as he kind of gets up to where I am
and I'll say like hey you uh
you you can uh
you can take in front of me yeah
alright I'm gonna move
uh oh
oh no not there
oh oh
pause pause no
I just see him jump off the edge
but where did you mean to do that
first of all
no okay
I will let you take that back
if you did not mean to do that
that that red line
I did not mean to jump off that red line is a
clearly a ledge of like
sewer water falling off the edge of this little tight
uh
hallway that you've pushed yourself through okay
havoc reaches forward
and just kind of grabs him and pulls him back
all right that that makes way more sense
havoc and the kid grab you
yeah oh
you might want to be careful there
it gets a it gets a bit hairy after the edge
alright oh
thank you that's
that's I seem to have lost my footing
I can't believe it I mean
the water is up to your waist basically
I kind of like jokingly tap them on the shoulder again
yeah you should yes
be careful we are in the source
yeah I will be very much more careful thank you
all right so uh
you uh
proceed down this hallway
uh you've spotted a second door
Sir Caitlin uh
it's just a few feet further than the first one
very similar in design uh
this one doesn't have the bolts on the outside uh
it does just look like a normal uh door setup here
I'm gonna knock on the door yeah
you knock
on the door and you kind of lean waiting for an answer
no no reply
I'm gonna open it okay
uh you open the door uh
this uh appears to be a uh
like back staircase maybe into uh
a building basement in water deep
uh best you can tell
okay
and do we know what's directly above us at the moment
uh roll a history check
we'll see if you have any on that
you already used your bonus
I'm gonna say that you you've already reached
into the depths of your knowledge
no no
you do not know where you are
nope then uh continue down
uh
I would kind of like to peek through this little area
if I can
uh okay
yeah uh
you peek through this area uh
it's a it's a ledge out over the uh like pool
uh basically that uh is here in front of you
the um sewer all of the sewers collect here
and kind of flow up to the north uh
it's kind of like maybe some like large like septic uh
um
like sewer basin
like it's a like water filtration tank here
they're doing something with best you can tell um
I mean the water is OK murky and deep
uh
you know
far deeper than anything that you've walked through
at this point you feel that you would be swimming
if you jumped into this yeah OK
yep just doing the check
sweet
uh havoc as you go in there
uh you
you uh
make your way up to like a little staircase
and above you is like a a floor hatch um
do you attempt to do anything on the floor hatch
yeah can I just kind of listen to it first and then uh
I might I might peek in
just depending on if I can hear anything going on yeah
go ahead and make a uh
uh perception check for your listening here
are we past the
are we past three hours from when I did my psychic link
no or we're still okay
I'll say we're still within your three hours tweet
uh yeah
uh you listen in here for a moment
uh you know
I think you'd have a pretty good understanding uh
Sir Cailin and Mora uh
and uh
Kate all agree
this is like the staircase to some basement
so you listen at the like trap door of this uh
basement and you don't hear anything
uh I'm gonna test it
I'm just gonna kind of
obviously they came out through here
there's a chance that they went out this way too
so just can I
can I just test to see if it's unlocked
did we check that already
yeah you push up against it uh
it does not budge there is no lock on the inside
it is a hatch that is it
it likes you clearly that's above it
you even feel that it's like weighted potentially yeah
Dark Souls this door can't be open from this side
no I would not do that to you
I'll let you go where you
wherever you wanna go at this point
nope I um
I'll notice that that that it's pretty rigid
I'll I'll communicate that to Cade
I'm gonna say
and then I'll make my way back to the staircase
waiting for that
I would say that you probably looked it over
there's no you don't spot the yellow sign of the
people that you're chasing at this point either
so perfect
alright
it looks like they either don't
it looks like they either don't want things to go in
or does they don't want things to come out
oh sorry
I didn't I didn't reneer didn't jump in
he's not that dumb
huh OK
uh yes sir Caitlin
uh you're at the front of the pack
everybody's kind of regathered into their line
you're leading your way through the uh uh
sewers here uh again
uh you see the uh fork ahead of you
the sewers split in two directions here
okay any yellow signage around
uh
no none
none that appears I'm gonna say that
you all are looking pretty intently for yellow signage
all right as you uh
turn this corner I'm gonna this uh
I meant to draw this just a little bit larger here
there's this refuse pile
and it kind of blocks the whole of the stream
so both sides of uh like the walkway and the uh
sewage path are like stacked with old furniture uh
like clothing has been dumped here
crates have been dumped here
it's like a a mound that you have to go uh
you would have to climb over
but it's it's uh
backing up the um
like sewer on the other side
uh so if you climb this
you definitely feel like you would need to uh
tread very carefully uh
into the space beyond so it's like the
the sewer is like flushing over the sidewalk beyond
this refuse pile
the other way looks that looks oddly like a den
yeah
yeah I think your instincts are on there
you roll a perception check for me
if you want to confirm your suspicions
or any other that you feel apply there Mora
alright
yeah this is uh
wow not very perceptive
that's alright uh
there is telltale signs of rat activity
uh in large quantity in this refuse pile
yes we should
we should tread very carefully
this is another fork if a din is that way
shall we go to the other end
I see no yellow signs
I don't see anything here
uh matching the signage again
if if you're not against the idea
I could always scout ahead
yes please
out the head
is this like water like walkable now
or is it still pretty deep
we're gonna do this this this
let me do a little free hand alright
so if you go this way that is all walkable water this
this refuse pile here is
is blocking both sides and this
this this area beyond is all like backed up
all right and then I would
I would step through the water
yep and get in front and then I would begin my search
kind of doing the same thing
trying to look along all the walls
for any yellow signage yeah
uh you make your way down this way
it's very apparent
you're on a cold trail going this direction
hmm
I I have good news and I have bad news
what do you want first bad news first bad news first
we're gonna have to go over the rat pile the good news
is that
well it's
it was really just bad news uh
we're gonna have to go over the red pile
you should you should work on being able to classify
good and bad news I was hoping it was gonna
we're gonna come to me yeah
we're gonna have to work on that there
there Gade yeah
I I try to not give bad news
if I can't give some good news
and I was hoping the good news would come to me but uh
yeah there's really no good news
how about how about just intelligence
how about call it that
uh yeah sure
very well
and then Kalin will just kind of hop over and then uh
work to can I jump over the refuse pile
uh alright
well I was gonna ask really quick as oh OK
sorry let's pause right here
uh
any action towards the refuse pile will uh
trigger this so uh
I just need to pause to validate everybody's actions
prior to Sir Kailyn jumping
if that's what he plans to do
I'm good okay
I was going to cast mage hand first
um do you want to hear out Kellen what
what havoc was going to do
oh yeah mage hand it up
okay cool
yeah so before we kind of run after it
just in the sake of trying to be a little more cautious
I was gonna cast mage hand and start to kind of
poke around in the pile just to see if I don't see uh
what could possibly coming at be coming after us um
I would prepare to cast some prestidigitation
which I fucking stumble over that word every time
um
in the hopes that if I see something
um
getting like acting out I'd like to make kind of a
a a
flash of sparks and such
on the other side of the refuse pile
to try to distract it
so I'm kind of I'm prepping at the same time
I don't know if I can do all that at once honestly
but that's what I like to do yeah
I think mage hand you're like I
I think if if we're trying to lay out timelines
I'll
let you do one thing as Sir Cailin takes his action
if he truly wants to jump
so Mage Hand was first talk
I think you're perfect
you're digging through with Mage Hand
uh yeah
Sir Cailin you are committed to jumping
is that correct
um
I'm committed to him following through with mage hand
and then taking action after that okay
do we I don't
I don't want to take away from his ability
that was a cool idea
do we want to pause for a break here for a short moment
or we go to go into
cause we're gonna go into a combat here
I'm good I'm good to charge through
but I'm also good for a break if we need one okay
uh you have to go either way
let's let's take one
cause we're at about an hour and a half right now
uh and we were all in here a little bit early
so uh
let's OK how about how about a short one
we'll say five minutes and then if uh
we need to take a longer one later
how about that
yeah that works alright
five minutes then alright sweet
I'm gonna hang on the channel
I'm just gonna walk and grab myself a drink
I will say I typically like to do a little bit I
I I like using my Cantrips and and shit if I can
so oh yeah
the finding fun ways to use Cantrips is one of
the best parts of playing a spellcaster
cause they're free things
and if you can get creative with it
you can actually have some major effect
I am wild I feel I
I feel wildly unequipped to play a
a caster here
but I appreciate you guys suffering through it
I think I I don't think I've ever not played a caster
to some degree
yeah I mean
I played clerics and yeah
but I think this is just different
it's a little different but not much
my first caster was a druid
after almost 3 years straight of rogue
an assassin rogue and it was yeah
a lot more a lot more things to do yeah
a lot more things to do as a druid than a rogue
assassin
I I found that I had no idea what I was doing
and that was completely fine
because as you level up and you get more options
and you discover things and you play things
it really plays into the
leveling your character as a caster
so being lost in the beginning is absolutely
the right direction for a caster haha
oh yeah
like people
and that's the only reason I'm playing it is I
somebody gave me that same kind of like that
that was their kind of concept behind it was like
alright I'll go cause I love the idea
but like even trying to help Cade like learn his magic
I'm personally freaking out cause I'm like
I don't fucking wouldn't sorcerer know this
which is
which is why it's perfect that you're a wild magic
sorcerer cause you don't know how to teach a wizard
how to learn spells but you're going to try anyway
he's gonna end up just basically doing it himself
but still giving you the credit
cause he doesn't understand it either
he's just reading books
you're telling him to do things and he's just doing it
it's like oh
it works
there we go you're so smart havoc wow
he is the best
you know what it works
it is funny that it perfectly works yeah
it is funny that uh Kalin said uh
let's try intelligence and Kate's like
uh yeah yeah
and I'm I'm
I'm I'm almost positive
Kate has the highest intelligence by like four points
mmm hmm uh
cause I have an 18 intelligence
I was lying
so yeah all right
someone once said intelligent OK
oh sorry
good no
jump in if you want
we have moments still
oh OK
um someone once said that intelligence
was the measure of one's capacity to learn
not what they knew yes
so taking that flavor of your intelligence
is that your capacity to learn
is exponentially higher than everyone else's
that doesn't mean you've Learned how to use it yet
that is true I am also that works in real life
I am also the youngest
by a good amount I think
yeah I'm not quite sure what Sir Kailen's age is
but definitely younger than Sudara and stitch
and definitely you more yeah
little long in the tooth but it's alright
hey uh guys
I just wanted to let you know uh
the uh listener that we've had
it's actually my brother I just didn't know if like
I didn't want to reveal any uh weird uh connection
but uh he's uh been enjoying the game so much he uh
wanted to know if he could play and uh
I just wanted to give him an opportunity to say hey
just while we were at a break and come into it
cause it's been a
I feel like it's been a pretty good session thus far
so yeah man come on
I'm not against having another player
I know that we said that we were gonna close it to five
but I mean I'm I I think six is
six to like
five to six players is not that big of a difference
um
so I think it was more introducing somebody random
yeah that no yeah
come on thank you guys
um this is my first exposure to any D&D
um my brother's been at it for a while
but he pretty much always introduces me to games
and he's uh
dragged me into this one with
you know talking about planning and
doing some things with you guys
and we've been
trying to work on some things behind the scenes
so I appreciate you guys letting me see how it goes
and it's been very fun to watch you guys interact and
and learn as you go so um
I've I've just been
much more entertained than I thought I would be already
and I know you guys are just getting warmed up so
oh yeah yeah
thanks for letting me ask you on the wall so far
yeah for sure
oh yeah it's always exciting
having someone that's never played D&D
hop in and play
I mean I corrected Roach
that's that's his entire origin story to D&D
it is 100% most accurate yeah
I'm all for it more minions
more minions what
I think I misunderstood your character a bit
why no
I am a I am a man of the cloth
you don't misunderstand a thing yet
oh god yeah
I'm an adult I'm 22
I swear
no I'm actually 25 in real life
but alright
cool well
thanks for uh being welcoming of him
uh he's gonna continue to listen for this one
but uh we'll talk about rolling him in
and I'll keep you guys in the loop uh
if he does decide to play
so thank you sweet
uh alright
so really your uh I'm just coming back
your path is utterly blocked
a massive solid dam of debris is wedged in the tunnel
a testament to the city's wastefulness
it's comprised of the wall of civilization's
got splintered crates the leg of a chair
stained mattresses bleeding in their stuffing
uh rotting vegetables
heaps of discarded rags
all cemented together with MUD and filth
the sewer water unable to pass has like uh
formed a stagnant pond behind it uh
and the wall itself is weeping
a slow concentric of liquid
so like that that sewer that you see is blocked
and there's like a pool of water
you're not quite sure how deep but obviously there is a
some issue if you go that way
let's get my screens back in order here
and I'm gonna unpause we peek over
can we see how deep it is
uh or is it pretty
pretty murky who is
who is going
I just need to know what like if you're going into it
I need to know who is going
because there's one person
singularly that will start that right
so who's going if you're going
EWW
I'm not going anywhere I
I was still I was still poking it with me old maid hand
I'm on the other side here
I okay
I think that's gonna be sir Caitlin first okay
and everybody you think everybody's on the other side
ha ha it would appear that way
I I
I'm gonna let you play table play reneer and Sudara
I would expect that this would be the order probably
yes
yeah yeah
OK alright
uh alright
so Kaylin as you uh
step onto this uh
the like unmistakable like
squeal of rats and such come scurrying out from this uh
two swarms of rats uh appear
uh and they like
are like like
just like trickling down this uh
the face of this massive pile
and you can kind of like
see them balling on either side here
uh they come
come out of that before you uh
they uh
this is like as you step in
so you're in the space that the rat is in
on the ledge of the refuse pile here uh
and as you uh
wiggle in there uh
is a oh shit I just logged out of
I hate when I do that oh
we just had a we had a world catastrophe event
I it's all destroyed
yep all good
uh yeah
there's a uh
like rumbling sensation underneath your boots
uh you have stepped on a giant
oh shit
okay
everybody may roll for initiative here
um do you feel this would surprise you
I feel like you were prepared to step into some shit
here so I'm gonna say like yeah
no true no true surprise round
like your shield is up
and as soon as you feel this thing you're
you're uh going
so I'm gonna say y'all were prepared
let's roll initiative let me just
let me get my rats uh
can I move you back for a moment
sure how about it OK
boom we're gonna go combat
you should be able to roll for initiatives
initiative
alright let me get
Renee and Sudara
I thought it was an 11 but apparently it was in that 20
nice I'll take it haha
yes I do need to start combat uh
we are at the top of the order
OK you are first yeah
how big is the centipede
can I even see it really from here
yeah uh
there uh
it's small in size but it's giant for centipede
so the the size is actually small
but I would say it's like probably a like 4 or 5 foot
oh jeez that's huge okay
you know but it's yeah
flat and like true wriggling out from the yeah
pile here okay
I think Cade would immediately upon seeing the rats
yeah even before really seeing the centipede
uh Kate does he darts forward through the water okay
I'll go uh
I'll go 5 10 yep
uh I can move through them right uh
you're climbing up the um
you you would be climbing up the refuse pile now
at this point so if you are climbing over the rats
I'm gonna make it at a at a
you'll have to do a strength check
or an athletics check if you want to climb up the pile
okay I'll do a I'll do an acrobatics then okay
yeah would describe your
your action here or your attempted action
and then roll for me yeah
based based on my role will be how I describe what I do
it's like a wave of rats
like coming out of this thing and like
you can see the top of the pile
but uh you know
it's it's a little ways up there
oh that would have been so good if it didn't flip
yeah um
I'm gonna say that you uh
have a good chance to make it close to the top
uh just
just describe for me how you uh
attempt it yeah um
I think he would
he would kind of try to try to leap himself um
like off of like the side of the
off of the side of the wall and then grip onto the top
um
OK would
would that take up the rest of my movement
uh I'm gonna say that you can get to this space
and you can land if you
if you want to land and stick the landing
that will take all of your movement
OK yep
then I'll do that um
I kind of clamber up to the top of the pile
then slide down it um
and stick the landing and then focusing
I will summon the two shadow daggers
and I'm gonna make two attacks on uh
this rat pile here okay
so I don't really even
I don't think I have seen the Centipede yet
in my own description and I will make those attacks
um let's see if how this works
OK
attack
um
for some reason that does not give me the roll option
1 second sorry
uh you should be able
to load the uh
oh here how does this
cause it's not considered a weapon
which is the it's
it's like a class action
one of these should let me roll the damage no
action
whenever you take the attack action
make an opportunity attack
you can manifest a psychic blade in your free hand
and make an attack with that blade
so you still need to do your uh
first attack yes
yes
but I can make my first attack with the psychic blade
cause this is the bonus like there's not
there's not the
I'm not seeing the psychic blade like action attack
yeah um
I'm only seeing the bonus action
oh that's not it again
I'm only seeing the bonus action version
on my character sheet
I thought the bonus action 1 would allow me to roll it
activities oh
here we go um
take it up
it looks like you're just gonna do your attack roll
with this
and what's your bonus to the attack roll still it's
yeah it would be
it's a it would be a
and it's so it's plus
it's a d 20 + 6 to hit and then the damage is 1 d 6 + 4
okay so I guess I'll just do that manually
yeah do a manual
yeah until we figure out how to add that button
yeah
and then plus 6 okay
12 uh
12 is a hit yes okay
um I will be uh
vexing it with my weapon mastery of daggers
okay uh
let's see
which just gives me advantage on my next attack
yep yep
and then damage and this is
it's piercing damage just still no it's
it's psych it's psych
it's psych it's psychic damage
so it it doesn't leave any physical marks on the body
it just damages their like insides okay
yeah just
just describe this like
cause the group has obviously never seen you do this so
uh you're like just slashing at this
like wave of rats that's pouring out of this uh
wall and uh
just describe like how your uh
blade is formed and you're cutting at these things
yeah uh
as he as he kind of slides down from the pile
um both of his arms kind of envelop in the
the same black smoke that you had seen previously
um as he just kind of like
he's reverse gripping them
and he kind of
just takes his right hand and kind of like swoops up
let me turn on my camera uh
it's kind of swoops up through the pile and kind of
like it looks like it almost doesn't do anything
but like some of the rats die in the pile
um but like
he just kind of like cuts through it and then the
the dagger disappears in that hand
as he kind of stabs down with his
with his left hand for another attack
okay yeah
go for your second attack then
yep
this is your do you have like two side blades
is that how I understand it
yeah so when I
when I make an attack with my action
with the side blade
I can use my bonus action to do a secondary attack
with the off hand okay that is also a hit then
and then 1 d 6 + 4 again
for 8 psychic damage
as he kind of stabs into another one
and kind of pulls it out um yeah
and then that would be
I should have rolled with the bandage
it's fine oh
sneak attack though
I will do my sneak attack damage with that one
because of the bandage yeah
I would say that it is
because Sir Cailin would be adjacent to it here
although he's not currently in that position
he is standing on this swarm of rats
next to the giant centipede
oh yeah I
I got it cause of VEX as well
uh when I hit with my first attack
yeah cool
cool cool
uh
normal so that is 8+ another uh 7 okay
uh yeah
this cool uh
I would say that the group is kind of uh
stunned this like uh
wave of rats that's like pouring out of this
you just kind of like you know
are like
slashing through this after leaping up on this pile
but this uh
this wave of rats is uh like
like they look like they're pouring out of their nest
but they're just like
slowly dying and falling to the ground
and piling at the bottom
and this swarm of rats is no more nice
and that is my turn
alright
oh yeah
so life is cool yeah I like this
alright havoc it's your turn to act
alright havoc is going to take aim
so one of these is gone now
alright that one's dead
I see yep
he's a uh
did Kailyn get an attack off on the rats or no
it just they happened after he won it simultaneous
all that happened at the beginning
Kailyn was the first to react in order
um I'm going to use Sorcerer's Burst
and I'm gonna actually go after the Centipede first
yeah you see this like
kind of like bug like
creature reaching its head up through the trash pile
and it's enough of a target uh
uh I'm gonna say uh yeah
I I'll let you roll normal on this
is that okay yeah
alright
you're going to cast a 17 to hit
yeah 17 is a hit
alright and I get to choose the
the um
type on this I guess
it says hold on
I just had it yeah
it's basically I just right
oh no
this one is this one is uh
truly a yeah
yeah I get to choose right yeah
um
I'm gonna do fire okay
and then I'll throw that I'll do a damage attack
it does not uh
seem to be any more or less susceptible to this
okay kind of like
you know like rise and pain
you're uh
feeling confident in your shot though
because there's numerous things here
that could potentially be set on fire
and then I'm uh
I'm gonna kind of tuck around this corner here okay
yeah I can still see it
you're in half cover yeah
from uh
anything in range attack here
but perfect and then I will intern I
I can intern through here somewhere right
uh yeah
in your combat I believe you can intern
I can always move there it is perfect
got it okay
uh it is Reneer's turn to act uh
he doesn't actually have any uh
ranged weapons you guys called
told him to kind of stay at bay
uh he's like uh
what do you guys want me to do
am I helping or am I watching
he kind of shouts to everybody
hmm
shoot something in here
he doesn't he doesn't
could I ranged weaponry can I I
I can't toss him anything of mine
could I a crossbow or something
no cause you have not on this turn yeah
you've done an action I will say at this point
uh I'm just gonna say he
he comes up here and just like prepares his rapier
if the rats or anything moves forward uh
he's ready to attack this open space
but obviously has given some room for people to move
alright
uh
be uh
Sudara's turn I think he would do uh
very similar uh
probably move here to the far side 1
2 3
yeah uh
and he would take a shot with his short bow
at the centipede
uh he misses
the arrow
just sinks into the sludge of the refuse pile
and we are on to
Mora will hopefully get his token working correctly
there we go move here
and then Mora will
or more than
target target
or more than
yeah that's a hit on whatever you're targeting
smash uh
that the rats
yeah the rats okay
yep
alright
they do have resistance to pure bludgeon
bludgeoning damage
that's cool
bonus action
joy fire damage
yeah constitution saving throw
oof
uh the rats uh
fail their constitution saving throw miserably
I'm more than slain
uh yeah
and that will be my turn you're like smash into this uh
like furniture pile like
I imagine there's like a table and like
stuff that you just have like smashed through entirely
like collapsing some of this uh
like refuse pile on down on top of a lot of these
like you just hear like the
the like smash of rats underneath your uh
swing and then this uh
like burst of fire comes from your uh weapon
just describe that and like
the additional
number of rats that are just depleted by this
Mora rushes in
shoulder checking the pile
and it scurries out
the rats as he brings his warhammer down
for more than clean
and as it makes bark against the stone at the bottom
fire raps singeing and burning the rats
many lay still and crushed
yeah the
the rats are kind of like scurrying in all directions
uh
it is their turn to act
if you're not doing anything else
is that correct
nope that's it okay
uh they can swarm
they can move through occupied spaces
uh basically anything
they can move to any space
and through any creature's space
uh so
they're just gonna swarm straight into the back lines
here havoc
and they're gonna be underneath you
and they do begin to attack you
uh sorry
I gotta go a little more here
uh they bite
ah let's see
18
uh it's actually 20 sorry
20 would hit I'm imagining
that will hit
uh you take
five points of damage from the rats
and that is their turn
giant centipedes turn I'm gonna move Kailyn
you on top of the pile
uh just to confirm where are we are in location
um sure
the centipede is definitely going to bite you
or attempt to bite you I should alright say
uh and it is a 10
I would have guessed it's Miss Miss yep
alright and then Sir Caitlin
your turn to act
this like wriggling sensation from under your feet
this uh centipede
kind of like rears up and is getting ready to bite you
it's been uh
uh fireballed uh
it's been shot at uh
and now it's your opportunity
as it just tried to bite you
uh side step its attack
okay I'm gonna go ahead and swing with the axe
oh yeah uh
fucking 19 thank you
yeah awesome
uh roll for damage
7 that's perfect still
uh this thing uh
you know lives down in the servers
it's uh
not a uh
long lived creature and uh
you've just uh
shortened its life
I kind of imagine you like side step its bite and uh
just describe what happens after that with this attack
cause you slay it
yeah I'll just side step
um kind of bring my shield arm up
and then bring the battle axe down
and cut its head off yeah
like uh
it just like
kind of like stops really wriggling for a moment
but the head rolls down uh
kind of the same direction as the rats
uh that was your action
uh I'm gonna say that you have full movement
like you're you stepped in and this is your uh
ability to react so you still have full movement here
uh I'm good where I'm at
I don't have anything
additional that I would like to do
OK um
this swarm of rats is within reach though right
currently no
uh
OK unless you have a reach
do you have a reach weapon
no okay
they're like I have five feet
okay yeah the
the rats are like swarming over
yeah this one's dead
right next to you this
this is the dead one this
this centipede is dead
the rats are in the space that havoc occupies currently
okay
I'll use a little bit of my movement to move down a bit
to let people up onto the sidewalk
if they would like yeah
and then that'll be my turn
thank you yeah
okay uh
seeing the swarm of rats kind of run towards havoc
and likely hearing him kind of scream after getting
like bit
uh I would like to climb back on top of the pile
OK to here
yeah that's like the
and I can see yeah
and I can see the rats see the rats here
yeah OK
I'm gonna spawn two more daggers from like in my hand
and basically and yell out a stitch
watch out and I'm gonna throw the first one
try to hit what like hit one of the rats that I can see
okay yeah
um let's just gotta do the d 20 again
d 20 + 6
I'm just gonna move everybody here for a moment
so that we can see the rats
for targeting purposes 17
yeah 17 is a hit roll for damage yep
um oh
I forget it should be 7 sorry
it should be plus 6 technically
cause it's 4+ my proficiency
no it's not
I lied I lied
nope it's just 4 okay
so 7 damage alright
yeah you uh
slash at these rats uh
you know with the same daggers that you've shown uh
havoc early this morning uh
they kind of just like flash around them
and the rats are just like falling uh
like twitching from the damage uh
you are able to defeat the swarm of rats
sweet and then holding the
the other dagger in my in my left hand
I kind of open my palm and it banishes
and I wipe my hands and say uh
you you alright
uh that will end combat
I'm gonna end combat here you are back free action
thank you boys
yeah hi
so last time I uh I soaked my shoes in gravy
I'm not sure exactly why they came after me but uh
good job guys wait
you have you you did what havoc
I must stop the bleeding first come
come here come here
let me stop the bleeding here
here there you go
hold on the bleeding you soaked your shoes in gravy
don't touch my goblin life
there are things about me you don't know
I kind of something a goblin truly does
first time I'm hearing about it and I kind of
I'll slide back down the pile
all right
so are we so past the refuse pile
is it still dry or is it backed up
it's it's backed up but uh
the sidewalk here
seems like there's like a platform built okay
underneath it that would support you
and as you progress down
are you still looking for Zanthar symbols
oh yeah yes yes
uh alright
everybody that's up here make a roll for me uh
investigation perception however you want
whatever I'll I'll survival
I'll accept whatever you throw at me here
good
nice snap 20s uh yeah
um I'm gonna go
oh yeah uh
like Mora and Cade's perspective
like I imagine you guys are like uh
uh like walking each of you is focused on one walk
kind of confident in the others abilities
you've already spotted them
you walk up and down this tunnel
and
you think that this is certainly the way to something
but you don't spot any symbols of the Xanathar here
no signs perhaps we should check the other way
the other way was clear I already uh
I already checked it
I think we might have to go for a swim guys
I mean it wouldn't
it wouldn't be smart of them to have a a symbol
too close to each other
they probably still want them spaced out enough to
you know
have somebody that at least knows the general path
which way to go
if I if I post up right here yeah
can I can I kind of look without stepping in
can I look down and see anything
yeah so that's kind of like the same
I'll do the same red line here
like this is a drop off into the right pool below this
this little ledge here you can see uh is
uh like that's probably oh
you've got dark vision you can see pretty far out there
I think yeah
I have it uh
the room beyond kind of just opens up into the void
like there's a uh
like you think that there's like a large
massive tank or something in the uh
uh like room ahead
um
there
it looks like maybe possibly some stuff that you could
like jump between if you uh
were really uh nimble
uh but uh yeah
like nothing stands out as like
Xanathar in either direction
now that you've been here for a bit
but you can't see I don't think
you can see all the way to the end of the room here
I think that your limit is
is here if I'm not mistaken right
yeah yeah exactly exactly
so yeah
I don't see the full room
I mean
I don't know if any of you others
yeah you uh
slash at these rats uh
you know with the same daggers that you've shown uh
havoc early this morning uh
they kind of just like
flash around them and the rats are just like falling
and uh
like twitching from the damage
uh you are able to defeat the swarm of rats
sweet and then holding the
the other dagger in my in my left hand
I kind of open my palm and it vanishes
and I wipe my hands and say uh
you you alright
that will end combat I'm gonna end combat here
you're back free action
thank you boys
yeah hi
so last time I uh
I soaked my shoes in gravy
I'm not sure exactly why they came after me
but uh
good job guys wait
you have you you did what havoc
I must stop the bleeding first
come come here
come here let me stop the bleeding here
here there you go
hold on the bleeding
you soaked your shoes in gravy
don't touch my goblin life

everybody that's up here make a roll for me uh
investigation perception
however you want whatever I'll
I'll survival I'll accept whatever you throw at me here
god
nice snap 20s uh yeah um
I'm gonna go oh yeah
uh like Mora and Cade's perspective
like I imagine you guys are like uh
uh like walking each of you is focused on one wall
kind of confident in the others abilities
you've already spotted them
you walk up and down this tunnel
and

nothing stands out as like
Xanathar in either direction
now that you've been here for a bit
but you can't see
I don't think you can see all the way to the end
of the room here
I think that your limit is is here if I'm not mistaken
right yeah
yeah exactly exactly
so yeah I don't think you can see the full room
I mean I I don't know if any of you others can uh
let me look at Sudara just to be fair
no he doesn't
he doesn't have any
and reneer has nothing that can be of use
is there anything else in this refuse pile
now that the critters are gone that uh
that of interest while we're looking around
yeah let me see if you find anything
um I think uh
you're gonna like
spend some time here looking around in the Refuge Spa
I'm going to yeah at this point
I don't really know what the next steps gonna be
and I'm just kind of a jittery guy
might as well hover and look through some stuff alright
uh what are the rest of you doing
I'm just curious you
you haven't found Xanathar in the path that you uh
followed beyond the sludge
uh
are you still considering going that direction
what is what is the thought of the group
um not sure we appear to be lost
definitely Kade would feel somewhat confident that
continuing down this path would
is going to be better than going back the way
cause he had checked all the other ways and they were
they were all like dead ends
okay then uh follow Cade's intuition
I think the blue might be onto something there
Sir Caitlin Havoc
come we proceed
uh alright
so the uh
this like
backup of sludge
kind of gives way to the normal flow of the sewer
after you've been walking for some time
you uh
come back to a like uh
criss cross you switch to the other side and the uh
sidewalk on the other side
just seems a little bit more raised and uh
it's like finally
out of the muck that you've been walking in for like
the last half mile or so you feel um
same combat order just out of curiosity
Kay uh
Kaylin at the front Kade Havoc
Mora Sudara Renier
yep yep yep
OK I'm putting you on the scene here
and then I will switch over to it give me just a second
alright and then Mora and then Sudara
and then I gotta get Ranier again
okay let me activate this
uh and then
let me give you a little read here before we continue
um
do do do
uh you proceed into a uh
like wider vaulted uh
tunnel here the air uh
tasting of rust and wet fur
the sound of dripping is fainter here
replaced by a low guttural growl that slightly
echoes slightly in the larger space
um you uh
uh
see the uh
uh alright
you actually do see the symbol of the 10 spoke wheel
here again
freshly painted in that garish yellow
a stark sigil of the ownership on the damp
moss covered stone but uh
I'll let you continue from here and kind of explore
I kind of point at the 10 spoke wheel and say
this one looks uh
fresher than the others
could be a good sign could be a bad one
well I doubt they'd mislead their own at this point
and that pile wasn't exactly something that
one willingly walks through on a daily basis
if you know what I mean
oh uh havoc
I I'm gonna give you um
you did find a uh small
uh lost
you found a lost purse in the uh
um
uh uh
refuse it did have 3 dragons in it
3 gold let's go
alright I'll take it
okay rule number yeah
40 whatever
always check the refuge files for gold purses
alright and I'll
can you yeah
can you point where the yellow signage is
yeah it's a
it's up ahead down this hallway here
I'll I'll just draw this
this is where you see it oh
that didn't draw anything this is where you see it
alright
yeah it's like I said we go ahead and head in
I am proceeding slowly being careful
yep like I'm
I'm giving you all benefits of the doubt here
I I trust you're ready
shield up axe up right
yep yep
um now we're at a fork
yeah this Caitlin will stop and let them know
yeah you uh
point down the tunnel to your south here
it looks like a another like um
like maybe an entryway to a basement uh
but uh
from even where you're standing at the end of it
you can see some rubble
it looks like it's been like caved in on purpose
uh
at the end of this
all right and looking through the halls
do I see any recent signs of uh
footsteps or dust being kicked up on either side no
all right
um can
I'll investigate go down here
oh wait
there's nothing there yeah
that's that's the like cave in segment
it looks like uh
kind of similar to the other staircase you went in uh
you know okay
there I would expect maybe there was
like an old door frame here
and like there's nothing on it now
but yeah you would be able to tell uh
somebody filled that in on purpose
alright we'll uh
continue here yep
chamber opens up to your north
uh there's kind of like an island
looks similar to like
maybe the filtration tanks that you saw in the uh
like previous area uh
the water does deepen the
the the runoff here
drips down so there's a
there's like a a drop off here
uh but best you can tell
it's still like only like knee deep down below
if you go to the north uh
down uh
this way here uh
water is flowing so water is flowing like this
okay
all right um
I'm gonna move forward okay
curve around this for a second yep
I'm gonna pause right there
hmm okay
hmm hmm would our spacing be directly behind him
if we were keeping pace with him
just for our positioning was
I'll move you if your positioning
yep thank you
I figured we wouldn't stray too far apart yep
let me move Sudara and Renier
to catch up
alright let me
oh no I meant to give reneer uh
my bow and arrow while we were traveling
you can you can give it up
my crossbow you can give it up
yeah go for it
alright yeah
I'm gonna pass on my crossbow
how would I do that I'll just
I'll just take it from your sheet and use it
uh perfect OK
alright uh so you are
um
uh as you uh
like proceed along uh out from
a uh
crouched corner uh
in the murky shadows on the right side of the path
uh stepped two monstrous shapes
they're giant rats each the size of mastiffs
their muscles are bunched and their black
matted fur are in grime are with grime and blood
their lips are pulled back in like a permanent snarl
revealing long teeth sharp enough to tear
through leather and flesh with ease
standing between them rocking lightly on the heel
on the balls of his feet is the source of their loyalty
he's a halfling
though his form is a twisted mockery of his kin
he's got gray
black fur sprouting in pouches from his neck and arms
his face and is narrow and feral
and he's kind of like constantly twitching
he's got sharp yellow teeth
his uh
eyes are small and black and uh
he's like uh
good evening gentlemen
and I'll uh
show you here he steps out from this space
and he's got these two rats with him
and they are oh
how far he is away from you at the moment
okay uh
Caitlin will respond
good evening sir
Brat
almost kind of confused yeah
he's like listen
I have a name don't need to be insulting
I said good evening gentlemen
is it are you uh
gonna cause trouble here this evening
you're in charge of the territory now
and if you plan to go this way
you're gonna pay the toll
I hate to be that guy uh
sir but it's uh
it's the morning
what uh
good morning no
I said good what morning already
huh uh
yeah time flies when you're on duty
listen and uh
what what
what duty is is that he's like
uh
I ask the questions here you're on shardshana territory
you gotta pay the toll just for talking to me now
you're wasting my time
and he's like hundred gold dragons
then you can keep walking
100 gold dragons
Geez yeah this is too much robbery
now gentlemen we don't
we don't have to fight you
you wish to exist
we do not wish to fight unless you would harm us
well you think you're gonna harm me
if you attempt to cause harm to us
then we shall defend ourselves
but we do not wish to defend ourselves
unless you make us oh
so you you like to fight like gentleman
yes well
some of them do oh
he's like well
and he like takes off his coat
you can see
he's got kind of like like wraps around his hands
he's like
listen it's been a slow night
if you don't wanna pay the gold dragons I'll tell you
I'll fight you for it I'll fight you for the toll
you beat me you'll let you pass
how about you simply let us pass
and no fighting or harm to either of us is necessary
oh well
you got a little God watching over you do you good
he can hear me watch you beat the faith out of you
come on let's have some fun
he's talking to you specifically
havoc is is kind of grinning at this just uh
I've got money on I've got money on Kalin yeah
he's like oh
look at this little one
all these fancy robes and no muscle
I'll knock the words right out of your mouth
what are you even talking about
all right all right
Kailyn you wanna just go and just wallop this guy
let's just get past him we got things to do right
we gotta rescue flun
this this song is nothing if you don't do it
I will I will I will fight the gentleman
he's he's like ah good
I've been waiting for this
he's like no weapons fists only yeah
you beat me actually
maybe see Dara should do this now
actually we have someone that prefers 50/5 to cuffs
so how about Sudar to go
and I'll let you guys roll for his attacks
if that's the case
yeah yeah
do it do it alright
alright alright
do it
I just I forgot we had monk with us man
this would have been perfect for him if he was here
I know
uh alright so his he gets uh
just confirming his bonus
so that we can do this accurately
so on an unarmed strike
he can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action
so he can attack
he can action and bonus action unarmed strikes and uh
he has
what is his a martial die
so he rolls a d
6 instead of damage for his unarmed strike
um but it doesn't look like he adds a
proficiency or anything to that
uh
I think I'm reading this correctly
so uh his attack roll would be
1 d 20 + 6 and he'll do 1 d 6 damage
but he can double attack basically
he's also got a ninjato which will
do like slash damage but it's the same effect
so it's like um
but they've agreed to fight fist to cuffs only right
yeah okay
alright fist to cuffs only
so 1 d 20+ six uh
the Shard uh the
like Ratman Halfling takes off this
like leather cloak that he's been wearing and uh
he kind of like gets into a
like boxer's fighting stance
and he uh
uh he says
and the two rats like
sit back down in the alleyway where he came out from
and he steps forward and Sudara steps forward
and they're just like uh
circling each other on the uh
pavement here for a moment
let's uh roll just straight initiative between them
who's gonna roll initiative for Sudara
his uh initiative can do it
what's his bonus yep
let me get that for you it is a plus 4
okay
ho ho ho fuck yeah
uh ha ha ha nice 23 uh
he did get a pretty good roll uh
his was uh 18 so uh alright
Sudara's turn to act I'm gonna guess uh
double punch is the action
what else does he have okay
like flurry of blows I think
I don't know if you wanna use any of his bonus actions
we'll just say martial arts straight up
no martial arts straight up um
so I'm guessing it's a 1D 20 + 6
like you said hit
alright I'll do that
yes first one's a hit
yep alright
what's the damage uh
it's 1 d 6
1 d 6+ what uh
it's it unarmed is 1 d 6 there's no bonus to it
okay um
I didn't know if he got anything being a monk
but uh good to go
yeah I uh
that's cute I'm looking through
I don't see anything for
shouldn't martial arts allow him to add his dexterity
modifier and proficiency
yeah that's what I was thinking yeah
martial arts die see
this is says martial arts die
you can roll 1 d 6
in place of normal damage on your unarmed attack
strike or monk weapons
this die changes as you gain monk levels
dexterous attacks it just
you can use your dexterity
it says instead of strength modifier
yeah for attack and damage
uh
there you go in addition
1+ your strength modifier and damage
dexterity modifier instead of your strength modifier uh
I don't truly see anything
I mean his
let me just OK
let's if I read it right here
it says damage
you make an attack roll against the target yeah
I just show you on his sheet for all of us
that you can see I don't see anything
but if you see
if you read under damage it says
your bonus to the roll equals your strength modifier
plus your proficiency bonus
okay so on a hit
on a hit the target takes bloodseeding damage
equal to 1+ your modifier
alright so it's 1 d 6 + 4
I'll I'll go with that ruling
okay 26 + 4
yep uh
so that's 6 6
all right and then uh
bonus attack action attack roll
same thing that was the 21
yes so it was a hit
so roll uh
yep same attack but uh you can do 1 d 6+ four
okay uh 1 d 6 + 4
read that extra plus 4 there you go
nice seven
yeah uh
I don't think the rat was ready for uh
Sudara's swiftness but uh
he does like a quick combo on him and uh
you can see the rat uh
has taken some punches but was maybe not ready for uh
what Sudara has thrown at him
uh he punches back
it doesn't actually have an unarmed attack form
so I'm just rolling
uh 12 against Sudara is a miss
he gets two attacks though as well
uh 14 is also a miss
uh so he's like
uh on the back heel
uh and we're back to Sudara's turn
does somebody else want to roll for him this round
or you keep let Kalin keep going
Kailyn's doing well personally
no takers we keep rolling Kailyn
alright so that's 1 d 20+ six
roll
14 uh
14 is a hit yep
OK awesome
uh so that's 1 d 6 + 4
roll
8 it's an 8
yeah he's a
like blood coming from his lips here
and then your second one
all right and that is a same 1 d 20
yep or no
1 d 20 + 6
all right
alright this is the 15 hit yep
alright and um
here we go alright
uh
I'm assuming this is a non lethal hit
yeah yeah
it's gonna it's gonna knock him out okay
yeah uh
I think like Sudara is probably a uh
pretty well trained fighting monk and has just like
comboed this guy uh
I mean I think that probably in his circles
uh and where he's fought before
he's probably pretty formidable
but uh
this is like I would imagine like a spin kick
like Vandam style
and he like bounces the rat into the wall
and the rat is uh
knocked unconscious kind of laying there before you
the two uh
giant rats are still still there
but like whimpering uh
like they don't wanna come out
uh cause they're obviously afraid of Sudara
but uh
they're like edging at the corner
uh watching as uh this
kind of unfolds here and we're uh
I'm gonna say end combat here
you're back to free action
uh this guy is out on the ground at the moment
nice job there uh Sitara that was pretty nice
well done
dark excellent timing
your combat instincts are impressive
yeah he's a like pretty
a like just kind of business about the situation
a kind of bows a
like
he bows to the rat man first before you guys approach
like even though he's unconscious when he turns around
he would bow to you like you know
thank you thank you for the opportunity
and kind of walks over to the rat
enjoy your nap gentlemen
you just like step over him
you know I mean
you gotta respect him I mean
he at least uh
gave us a good a good gentleman chance
you gotta you gotta
I can appreciate that and as uh
as I walk by I'm gonna toss a gold to the
to the rat from the purse that I found
okay
all right uh
you uh
continue down um
there's a couple alcoves here that seem like
they would certainly be uh
useful in a type of ambush type situation
um but uh
you continue down
doesn't seem to be any presence in them
as you continue down uh
are you still looking for uh symbols
oh yeah yep absolutely
it's
it's been a while since you've seen anything that seems
Zanathar related um
since you kind of went back the other way
uh
go and roll a any anybody that's looking
give me another roll here again
I I'm open to all
all skills
oh yeah there we go yeah
uh sir Caitlin
you're at the front of the group
um yeah
you you walk on this for a while
uh you had seen that freshly painted sign
but the the path here uh certainly seems to
uh
take you uh
like down a uh
stretch and then suddenly uh
things start to seem uh
a little bit more familiar to you as you uh
come back to
let me show you
you're just kind of all over the place but
we're back at the entrance again
uh it
you've walked uh it appears in a loop
I mean
there was that staircase that went down
the one that wasn't blocked
used to disbelieve
when I walk down this left path
when I kind of initially investigated
does it continue forward or did it
does it actually stop oh yeah it continues
okay but
but no yellow symbols but no yellow symbols
I'm gonna the last
I'm gonna flat out tell you that you uh
followed a path that did not have a symbol
and then came upon a like
super nicely freshly painted one
uh compared to all of the other ones
not being nice and freshly painted
that's that's all I'm gonna give you on that
but uh
the path that you went down
at one point
you knew that there was no symbol at that path
and you went down it anyway
hmm
okay so there was a symbol on this path
so I guess we would go back down the way that we
but take the same path that we see the symbols
okay up until that point
yeah okay
yeah
let me reset
the scene here then just again
okay I'm gonna reset fog of war as well
just cause it's gonna play into what you will find out
again and then
and I activate and you are here
oh that's a light you don't need a light
you uh
Kalin you've approached this room
you feel already uh
before uh
there is a you know
like the empty like carpeted room here
it looks like maybe like a waiting area of sorts
the familiar bolted door
like heavily bolted
but not actually bolted currently door
and the open door that you've left behind
of the staircase that you climbed and found
laden with weights that you could not move havoc
again there's a path to the north that
I don't know if you can see
no it's
it's a out of sight of where you are right now here
okay so then why not go south
I think it meets here and then I can look up
oh yeah up that way right yep
okay so okay
you see uh alright
uh you're
if you step there roach
you are in the water
you're just stepping into the water
so I'm assuming that you wanna stay on the ledge
the water is kind of pouring down over that
into this tank uh
really you want to probably stand where Cade is
because I think you do have the best vision
to see this OK
um I'll move
OK give you that space
alright so from here there's
there's very clearly like
a surface that you could jump to in this room
but uh
it's here I'm gonna just the tiles
uh can you see the
you can see this tile here
this tile here yep yep
and this tile here at the end
yeah uh huh yep
they have like
light amounts of water rippling over them
but there's a
there's a surface that you feel you could stand on
if you got to that point
all right uh
sir Caitlin's gonna go ahead and jump okay
make a uh
athletics check here for me please
this is the uh furthest one
okay um
here we go normal
oh yeah not 20
I'm gonna say how far do you really wanna jump out here
you land on this one with ease
I'm gonna say that you could like
kind of like feel like you could make it to this uh
with this action if you really wanted to
yeah I'll go ahead and do that okay
yeah you jump all the way out
just to kind of clear the space for everybody
as you do um
there is a like
uh
I'm gonna say like a uh
it's like a like a whoosh of the water
like something has moved in the water after you've uh
made this jump uh
maybe you don't see it specifically
but uh
Cade you kind of see like
uh
following like it uh
like
a light ripple generated from something in the water uh
too murky for you to see though
crap I would follow suit behind him
and also jump to the platforms okay
yeah athletics check for me please
could I do acrobatics as well
acrobatics yeah
absolutely okay Kailyn
as you uh
stand in this room there is a um
there is a uh
visible symbol of the Zanitar Guild
uh very worn on the wall
immediately to your left over here
so this this side
okay but am I made aware of the
the thing in here okay
do you say anything as you jump to um
I rolled a 10 yeah
is that enough to to get to the platform
uh I'm gonna say that you like splash the water here uh
like how far you're like halfway up
I mean I think that you're pretty
pretty nimble
and could probably press yourself out of the water
pretty quickly
um yeah sorry
uh yes
alright as I get to here I
I will shout out once I get to here
cause I felt like I was a little too far here
to say anything
without being too loud
so I get here and I say Caitlin in the water yeah
uh you have like just
and I kind of point point towards the ripples yeah
you were uh
you were pointing towards the first ripple that you saw
that went more towards Kalin but uh
you find uh
as you like pull yourself up out of this uh platform uh
everybody get to exactly where you are going to be
for this moment I'll give you a
a second to move I'm gonna guess
reneer and Sudara have moved forward as well
maybe sudara is out here and reneer is here
I do have a pocket full of ball bearings
so like
is the concept that there's things in the water here
like we're seeing some ripples right
so could I potentially take these ball bearings
um
and kind of cast them towards where these bubbles are
yeah uh
I don't think that the ball bearings are gonna have
like any major effect on anything
like I'm more just trying to see if I'm gonna
startle anything or yeah if it's gonna like
let me uh
or I think we're already to the point where
I think we're about to engage
so it doesn't really matter
I I need to speak up a little sooner
so uh
as you uh
like slipped on your jump a little bit Cade
you uh land with like your waist in the water
and you catch yourself on the edge of this platform
you quickly pull yourself up
the water is colder than you expected
it doesn't feel like water
it's a little bit thicker
you like it's definitely clung to your skin
um and then you feel a sudden push
uh like it's not a loud sound
but a feeling like powerful pressure waves that like
brushed from your legs from below uh
three giant frogs come like swimming up
they all kind of have surrounded you as uh
you were the second into the motion
this one doesn't see you he definitely will continue on
but these these two were uh
attracted by your uh
like leg in the water and they are amphibious
so they're swimming but they're within range uh
so everybody will make a roll for initiative here
and I I'm just gonna step away for a brief moment here
I'm sorry
man I've been rolling like garbage
dude I
my acrobatics have been on point
but that's about it
I have a plus 8 to my acrobatics and I rolled a two
the dice giveth and the dice taketh
the dice taketh yeah
don't worry I'm getting them all out now
that way when we get to the final boss
I'll roll nothing but Nat 20s
watch what is your strength score
my strength is 12 so plus one
okay
your strength determines how far you can jump
when you make a long jump
you can cover a number of feet
up to your strength score
if you move at least 10 feet on foot
immediately before the jump
yeah I did acrobatics though
all right
actually you're supposed to do a strength check first
assuming that the height of your jump doesn't matter
and if you land in something that's
that's difficult to rain I don't know
the jumping rules have always been way too much math
for yeah
yeah I got you
for me I just like you've made an athletics
I mean
we can definitely get into the gritty of the strength
if you want to I
I had started to put that into the application
that I was building as like
understanding exactly how far you all could jump
from a running start from a standing jump
from a like uh
like how far you could actually jump up a wall
that kind of stuff I
I think that that would be useful
um
but yeah uh
it uh yeah
at least like a
a baseline of like without any other factors
if it's just a flat surface
how far could one jump with a
a start could be helpful
no I don't think
I don't think it matters I'm just looking at it yeah
like parkour jumping style out onto these platforms
you know over sludgy terrain
that you definitely didn't want to slip in
so I I think we're fine
uh yeah
alright so uh
havoc uh
begin combat
you oh
I alright
so roll so Dora and Renier
let me add them sorry
let me just I don't think they will yeah
you're still at the top
alright alright
so I'm pretty sure that if I cast true strike
it works for spells
um
let's see got it by a flash
it's magical insight
you make one attack with a weapon used in the spells
casting
no that's not it
no no
that no
uh I'm just gonna use Sorcerer's first then OK
I'm gonna maintain that yeah
uh Sorcerer's first
Oof 12 uh
12 does it actually oh fantastic
and um I'm gonna use
I'm gonna call this in lightning alright
which one are you on you're on this one right here yep
okay
lightning nice
2 alright
what what the heck is that
well
x 4
yeah one 8
I love that equation it's all for X
so you I don't know anything that just happened there
but but you
I don't know what the xd x 4 = 8 is in that equation
but it I don't either 1 d 8 rolled a two
yeah it just does 1 d 8 damage yeah
so alright okay yeah
we're doing good yep
applied to oh
I see what it if you roll an eight you can reroll your
oh that's right
add the damage it like compounds on top of each other
if you keep rolling eights
and it can do it four times
that's right that's right oh
exploding dice that's the yes yeah
it's exploding dice yeah
okay that's cool
alright so alright
and then I'm going to from there
no I really don't have anywhere to go
so I'm just gonna intern
this giant frog will swim this is the original
this is the original Frog Wave that you had seen
uh it presses forward
it actually like
slithers up onto this platform that you're on
it makes a uh bite attack against you Sir Kailyn
uh 12 miss okay
uh both of these ones are attacking
Kade
10 miss and this one is oh wait
it's not all of their turns
uh sorry
uh that first one is a miss
I'm just gonna disregard that second one
alright it's your turn to act
all right
um
the game is paused again oh sorry
thank you that's good
yes thank you
more will
hmm
got even more
there's a 22 hit yeah
22 absolutely hits are you on the same one
uh that havoc just shot at
I'm on the one closest to my person yep
perfect OK
and it
and it has not taken damage or it has taken damage
it has taken 2 damage
oh well
oh
it can now take a few more excellent
uh yeah
describe this
and what happens to the frog as it's like swimming up
after attempting to bite Cade
from the symbol on my shield to that of my warhammer
a glimmering glowing
design begins to form into the shape of a fiery anvil
and it screams forward at the frog
smashing against its skull
yeah uh
this thing is like swimming in the water
as this anvil smashes into it
and it just kind of like pulpifies and like you can
you're not really sure where the frog's guts begin
and the refuse of this sewer
like puddle end now at this point
alright and uh nice
nice move from that position or you stay put
uh I do not move from that position
and I as a bonus action target
aid okay
cast
sanctuary
alright that makes him unable to be
attacked until Duration's correct ends okay cool
basically around yep nice
alright Kate your turn cool
um I'm going to summon I'm I
I feel like I'm kind of crouched at this point
like I landed on the platform
I got kind of down on one knee
and seeing that the frogs have kind of
tried to bite up at me I'm going to summon two
both of the Shadow Daggers
and I'm gonna make my first stab on this one
right here
just get that okay that is 1 d 20+ six
I will roll that attack I should hit with an 18 uh
yeah 12 is a hit oh 18 is a hit sorry
I was only looking at the dice roll and then 7
yep damage
um I will VEX this one okay
um but I'm actually going to throw my left hand dagger
with my bonus action towards this one okay
um where Kailyn is
try to give him some extra extra space
that's a hit as well alright
um do I'm not quite sure on the rule on it uh
ranged attacks when you have an ally within 5 feet
is that with advantage
ah man that's like and does a throwing dagger count
that's like flanking level rules
but
I think that your sneak attack would rule apply here
because you have an adjacent ally
more than that OK
I would say you get advantage from a a sneak attack
not the cool I'll not flanking
yeah
OK yeah
that works I will roll that again
just in case if for some reason I get a natural 20 OK
uh very close nice
uh but OK OK
there is my give me damage there
damage for the knife and then the sneak attack OK
which is gonna be psychic as well
so total of eight plus five uh
13 on that one by alright
yep sir Caitlin and that will be my turn okay
I'm gonna kind of hold hold strong here
yep it's a Sudara's turn
he is going to short bow
at the first one that you attack there
he lines up a shot into the water
uh it goes wide
he's like if only he was in melee range
uh it is Ranier's turn
Ranier has a crossbow
but he's kind of like wedged in the way here like uh
nobody else can really fit out on the platform uh
do we say that he can take a shot with his crossbow
I mean he's shooting over Mora and havoc
I think that it probably would work
that is pretty short yeah
yeah more more is not that wide
I was thinking of tall I was thinking of tall
alright so reneer gets a
uh actually gets a plus
plus 4 to his ranged attack rolls with this
so it's 1 d 20 + 4
uh yeah he's gonna hit on this uh frog
what is the damage for the crossbow it is
1D 8+ four
he does uh 6 points of damage to the uh
frog swimming next to Cade here
well done alright
and we are on all those hours at your dad's range
seem to have paid off
yes
says I should your form shows true
I should have come more prepared
that lucky light crossbow is mine as well
Sir Caitlin was very good of you
thank you havoc
we shall make sure you get that back
or get it replaced if necessary
uh Sir Caitlin
you uh like sprung out onto these platforms and uh
had a opportunity to uh
be warned of the frog ripples following up on you
you were able to uh
swing around and prepare for this uh
he still was able to slither
like slip like a seal up onto like dock
kind of like
just like slipped right up here in front of him
stuck his tongue out but how do you react here now
um can I knock a frog prone
he is he is yeah
I would say
uh this is
this is why I wanted to talk about it
cause if he goes back into the water
I would say that he's hovering in water swim
he has a swimming ability
so yo I'm not knocking him back in the water
I'm knocking him down yeah
right here on this ring that you're on
you can knock him down
OK good to go
I I didn't know yup
I I've never thought about knocking a frog prone before
but first everything alright
uh bonus action shield
uh shelf prone yeah
oh nice
um
25 I
I don't know if a frog can beat that
no I uh
it's a strength contestant right
I can't yes
I can't beat it okay
alright then
I'll go ahead and attack at an advantage
with the battle axe yeah
alright uh
23 that's a hit and then obviously
damage is gonna be pretty solid 11 yeah
this uh
this frog kind of like
slipped up behind you and was hoping
to kind of catch you off guard it
it uh
lashed out with its tongue and you just uh
react uh
accordingly to something attacking you
uh describe this like finishing blow how
how do you send this thing toppling
with your shield and such
yeah Kailyn just kind of knocks the frog prone
like leaving like a slime on his shield
that very quickly somehow is cleaned off
and then um
Kailyn just kind of brings the battle axe down and he's
he frowns he's like
uh uh
taking life of a
such a simple creature should be necessary and uh
he just leaves the creature dead yeah
alright then uh
do you make any other movements
nope cool
oh that'll be my turn
oh I have it to the top
haha
um alright
I'm gonna do it again
I'm just gonna pop them with sorcerers first
target the right one
oh yeah nice
25 almost triggered my I gotta remember too
if I guess if I had a 20 is it a 20 or is it a 1
that triggers my wild magic uh
cause now that I'm level 3
I've got to make sure I keep a
an eye on that
but 25 to attack damn it
if you roll a 20 the wild magic surge happens
okay
yeah uh
alright so this uh
burst uh
on this frog uh yeah
this uh
describe like your spell uh
burst here as it uh
ex extends forward from you and uh
defeats this frog
so uh
lightning kind of shoots forward
um pierces straight into the frog
you don't see anything at first
uh a slight twitch
a steam and then the frog just kind of uh
burst over Cade's uh
leg there yeah
uh this frog kind of is rendered life
lifeless in the water uh
alright we are again out of combat now
you are free to act um
I'm gonna say that there's no inherent danger now
uh jumping
uh you can easily make that jump or uh
swim if you need to
uh and then you'll see when you get onto the platform
there's a tunnel to the right and a tunnel to the left
you've uh
sir Cailin has already identified which way to go
uh from here though you do need to swim uh
it like there is no other path
the the pool of water here is deep and it uh
like there is no walkway uh
you must uh uh make a swim here
are we making checks uh yeah
I
you're gonna be swimming for a little bit you find out
so uh I need everybody to do a uh
athletics check overall here
just see how well we're doing with your swimming
alright so what an athletics check
yep everybody's making an athletics check
let me get reneer and oh God Sudara up here
oh hahaha
the dice give it the dice
take it away all right
reneer got a 1819 in total and Sudara got a uh
athletics normal
12 all right
so who's the lowest here Cade and me
Kaylin Mora um
all right uh
Kaylin you didn't do so great either
uh so havoc reneers
uh Sudara in that order
uh sorry Reneer
Havoc Sudara in that order
uh yeah
I think uh
reneer would definitely prove his usefulness here
uh he's a strong swimmer and uh
you know kind of as each of you are uh
going through the um
throws in this tunnel
he's like catching up to you and like
he's like here
hold on to me for a moment
he's treading water like almost holding you
I think that you'll make it through here without any
significant exhaustion
checks here
and then let me reset
cause you are back into a different scene here
alright so the I
I appreciate it reneer
I got a little bit of sewage in my mouth
yeah I mean
you all are swimming in like knee deep sewage uh
uh you know
and it starts to like ramp up here now
so you've been swimming for a while
uh and the
the ramp uh
like I'm gonna move you back here
so sorry give me just a second here
I need to move tokens
uh without moving
those guys OK
do do do
me reset
okay we are back in our marching order
the channel kind of like ramps upward for a while
you kind of are swimming along
and then occasionally you're able to touch
and feel the the ramp of stone beneath you uh
the channel expands and it gives you way uh
there's another
like raised walking platform next to the water uh
you think you've been swimming for like
maybe like 10 or 15 minutes in this stuff though
so it's like y'all are soaked in grime
and probably stinking pretty foul to
uh I haven't at this point uh
and you are now back in a channel here
this looks familiar uh I sorry
let me reset the fog of war here
because you shouldn't have
true fog of war uh
there we go okay this
this area looks familiar as though you might have uh
been into a similar sewer nexus of sorts uh
I'll let you uh free act from here though
so wait we have been in this section before no
it it is there's a like familiar layout
like you are probably aware that there's like
elements of the sewer that repeat themselves
you know all through
all through water deep so
it's a similar
looking layout to what you've experienced before
we just passed this so
so how I will say that
my inclination is always to kind of
go down most hallways yeah
that might get us in trouble
but that's probably what havoc is gonna kind of
mention to you guys what he's gonna also maybe do
down which hallway this one
this one to the right here
just before we before we pass it
up and let things sneak up behind us
maybe at least get a good view of the of the hall
so I was just gonna kind of sneak through
I'm gonna this this won't exist in this version here
sorry that oh OK
OK rule No. 6 always check the hallways
OK any
any more symbols we see or no
yeah uh
kind of like the curve path
uh I would say uh
Cade and Sir Caitlin as you are uh
standing there uh
you uh
catch a glimpse down the curve of the hall
uh the familiar sight
uh just pause here for a moment
don't move any further okay
uh you see uh
the like
familiar sight that you met
when you first came down into the sewers
there is a uh
like a swarm of uh sorry
let me hear let me get to my notes and read uh
there is no sound of a trigger uh but
from the darkness of us
like the small tunnels ahead of you
uh there's a soft whirring buzz
like a swarm of fat
angry hummingbirds that fills the air
you can see five of these floating eyeballs like
like swirling around in this chamber
the central eyes are all flaring
with a malevolent light and they're all like
eye stalks are just kind of like
scanning in all directions
I I don't think that they would have spotted you
where you're standing at this point
would I be able to make a arcana check to see if I uh
if I recognize these things
uh yeah
I'll let you make an arcana check
oh yeah oh yeah
close to a 1 there haha
alright I'm gonna say uh
can you guys see these things in the channel now
no
yeah OK
yeah alright if
if Rosie yeah OK
yeah alright
uh alright
so that's that's where they are
um
the
uh uh
yeah so they're just kind of like
swirling around here at this point
uh and I
this was like
you noticed like the Warren sign of the Zanitar Guild
uh Kaylin
and then like
as soon as you could see down this distance
like you're obviously on the uh
path you need to be on here now
do I know what these uh
creatures are called sorry uh
kind of what their deal is
yeah I think that you'd probably
I have some understanding
uh I mean
you've been
you've all seen the beholder at the old Zoblob shop now
so I mean this immediately sends in your minds to a
some type of beholder kin uh
and uh yeah
I mean if you've worked in the underworld
uh and Kade
you've got some experience there
I I think that you would have an understanding that
these are like
aberrations of a beholder
okay so they're not like physical things
they're like summons that people do to like
be like Watch Dogs basically
OK
um I kind of uh
lean over uh
Moreira to kind of like get Sir Cailin's attention
I go uh
hey uh
those uh
those things over there uh
that's at first when we when we first entered the sewer
I didn't really think about
about it but thinking about it now
uh it's definitely the uh
Zanthar's way of kind of making sure that people uh
that aren't supposed to be in the sewers uh
don't go to their lair so once we are spotted by them
it's likely that whoever
is there will know that we're coming
so we can destroy them or should we sneak past them
this what should the plan be
there's no real sneaking past them
as long as this is the only pathway there
gonna have to destroy him to be quick
and then try to rush our way
so that way we can maybe surprise them
before they can get fully set up
have we no magic to distract them
I kind of look over to uh
to stitch and be like uh
do you got something
oh sorry
I didn't mean to click that
uh havoc uh
I just keep realizing sorry
sorry I
I I
I'm using stitch cause that's what Kate would
would call you by
but I realized that you're probably not
it's okay to hear stitch yeah
no I was
I was yeah
I'm sitting here not realizing I wasn't um
are we just deciding
we're gonna try to attack these guys
or we're trying to go around
no uh
Caitlin asked if we had any magic
that we could use to distract them
and I looked to you and asked if you had something huh
cause I do uh
so the challenge
let me see
am I able to kind of creep a little bit forward
I don't think I can see I let you pass me yeah
I don't think I can see any like a real avenue
even if I distract them we're gonna have to pass them
I can't
they either have to come to us or go further down
so I don't get the I don't think that's gonna work
but we could how long do you deliberate here
just out of curiosity
like literally 12 seconds probably okay cool
just want a clarity yeah yep
it wouldn't be long to figure out that
we don't have any other option
yeah I think we just have to charge forward
I think we just have to move alright
you are OK are you
I appreciate the opportunity
are you approaching as stealthily as possible
yes OK
and whoever's at the lead
make a stealth check for me
oh this should be easy
can I give him can I give him the help action
uh yeah
I'm fine I don't know how I would OK
are you are you yeah
that would make it a normal check yeah
oh yeah yeah
I'm proficient and stuff make it normal then
yeah there we go
no
oh what a tease
so close kid
you're like here
let me help you
and you kind of like go to like balance him
and you kind of just like shove him a little bit
he's off balance as he takes his first step it's like a
stumble uh Kayla
I'm gonna say that you like step out
uh I'm gonna move everybody just a little bit forward
but I'm gonna just say you're here
for sake of aligning everybody
everybody else was like moving up with you
uh we're gonna say here Kayla
you're gonna be
uh let me
let me switch Kade into this position and then Mora
sorry I don't want to put you outside the map
uh
let's go Mora here there
and then Cigara and reneer here at the end
alright
uh yeah
these things uh
like
immediately turn their central eyes all towards you
uh and it's like a chaotic storm of shimmering rays
uh
they are all immediately casting spells at Sir Caitlyn
this wasn't how it was supposed to go
let's roll let's roll for combat
uh actually I don't wanna do
I'm gonna make
all the gazers are going to act in unison
cause there's still groups
so I'm gonna just roll one for them here
alright here we go
you know I'm happy with the 15
I'm happy with that
I got double digits on my dice that's huge
alright and I gotta get Sudoku
and Renier in here
okay
you're up
alright this is a only a 5 foot wide tunnel here
so you're not squeezing by
but it looks like you do have line of sight
uh these float or towards the ceiling
so I think that like even on like the up angle
you might have a good line of shot over uh
everybody here
if you have anything that can make that distance
so they're like they're hovering
they're hundred and twenty feet
that's enough right
yeah yeah
and I just just to be clear
this tunnel is like a it kind of expands here
it's it's 15 by 15 they're almost like
I would say they're twelve feet off the ground hovering
um
I'm going to use Sorcerer Burst on the first one here
this close one here yeah nice
20 yeah that's a hit
damage
or uh yep
and that'll be it okay
uh sorry
it should have been my turn
alright so I don't have line of sight
my question is how tall is this like
like kind of curved chamber that we are in
and would it be possible for me to like
kind of
scale the sides of the walls with my hands and legs
and then jump over Sir Kailyn to this adjacent spot
right here no
I don't think you can get past Sir Kailyn
coming out of this
it's a it's like a 10 foot tall tunnel
but like I imagine he is
like
taking up the whole of the end of this at the moment
okay well
then that ends my turn okay haha
actually wait wait
you said that we could swap initiatives if we're above
can I swap mine to be below
sir Kayla
sure we can do that
okay cool
yeah I'll do that
then I'm gonna set you to 12 as your initiative
yep that's fine
still in first place cool
alright sorry I'm glad I remember
that
alright so Kayla
your turn back then
alright um
I think what I'm going to do here
um
I'm gonna cast heroism on myself okay
um
all right um
and then as far as what I can do with the bonus action
I don't have much
um
yeah I'll
I'll conserve what I have there
but I will go ahead and move forward
so that's five 10 15 20
25 30 okay
and then I'm gonna go ahead and
these guys yeah
so that'll be my turn okay
yeah they're
they're floating out of melee reach above you
in this cavern they're about 12 feet off the ground uh
but sure we'll go from there alright
uh then kid
you got the turn here you are
yep I will start off by using my bonus action to
cunning action dash
and then I will move 5 10 15
20 25 30
um this water is like walkable right
or is that it's shallow water here
30 um
35 40
um
these things are small enough to walk through them
right you're walking underneath them
underneath them oh okay
actually well
in that case then I will
I will stay back here just so you're aware
yeah
OK yeah
I'll stay back OK
I'll stay back here
where I was at my 30 feet of movement
um
and then I will uh throw a dagger at this one OK
oh 11 yeah okay um
yeah that is my turn okay
uh reneer is uh
up to act uh
he just kind of stays at the back of the pack as uh
directed until this kind of tunnel is clearing out
uh I think that he would ready to move forward and uh
have a action when the tunnel clears
so uh
we can play that out if the tunnel clears here
uh
but we're on to Boros turn
all right more will advance to see what this is about
uh
yeah as you turn the corner here more
you just see like there we go
five of those floating purple eyeballs
like veiny with eye stalks
uh they're all like
intently swirling around above
Sir Cailin and Cade's heads here
uh kind of like a dazzling colors uh
coming from their eyes at the moment
these ones the problem I'll say to Caden Kaylin
yes destroy the creatures
to make it happen good morning captain
yeah the front one's been damaged
the front one's been damaged yes
yay
alright he makes a wisdom saving throw
15 I succeed
yeah so
I think nothing on success for me
yep nothing on success
that is there's the there's can trip and the
that will be my turn okay
uh it is the gazer's turn
um immediately they start uh
uh sizing up this like very colorful chromatic ray
um
I think that two of them are going to actually
I think
three of them are going to use this dazzling ray
on you uh
heroism will immediately negate it against you
Sir Kailyn so you don't have to roll
but the other of you will uh
need to succeed a wisdom DC12 saving throw
uh this is Cade and this is Mora
uh I'm gonna say it's these
3 front ones that have cast
each of them have cast a ray on you
uh
okay and then uh
so give me your wisdom saving throws here
oh nice
a wiz god
uh DM to be
to be fair uh
her wisdom only does uh
frightened plus 10 hit points
oh I thought it was a charm
doesn't count no no
I just want to be accountable there okay
I'm sorry I thought I read that wrong
I was frightened uh oh
you know I am
I clicked the wrong one
because there's a fear ray that they would likely
be using uh
as well here so
uh cause this is the other option that I have
uh can you see these
yep yes
okay so
uh that's why I was uh
saying that they would negate you
but I I'm sorry if OK
I'm doing dazzling ray uh
so I'm thinking of this one
so you would make a DC12 wisdom saving throw for me too
then please
yep no problem
just wanna make sure I'm accountable
yeah I thought that they were the same uh
but I realized that there's two now okay
so that is a success
did I get everybody succeeds okay yep
uh these last two are going to hit frost rays on
both of them are on you Sir Kailyn
as you were the first one to charge forward
okay so dexterity 12 saving throw
this is only targeting me right
yes both of these are targeting you
so you're gonna need to make two saving throws please
okay and I still have my reaction
uh yeah
I would say you do
okay uh
let's see if I succeed here
yep um
that's a success perfect
then I'm gonna use my reaction okay
uh
shield master redux uh
not is it shield master evasion
yes it is
interpose shield slash shield master evasion
yeah if you're subjected
so yeah
so take no damage uh
so dexterity saving throw to take only have okay
the last year uh
so does this do half damage
let me see it doesn't do half
no only take half damage if you OK
yeah I see
if you're wielding the shield
you make no saving throw gotcha OK
alright perfect yep
uh yeah
so freezing rays will miss against you
uh these guys kind of like hover backwards
just a like hair in this direction here
and that ends their turn it's a sudara
I think sudara could get by you in this tunnel
havoc and he would probably have it
yeah I think this point
cause this gives him a little bit of cover uh
are you emanating any light
is anybody emanating any light still
this point cause Sudara
I should still have the
I should still have my light spell on
which gives me 30 feet of of light uh
I would imagine you'd have reapplied that
I think you've been down here longer than an hour
though is that correct
um I
I don't know that that'd be for you to judge DM yeah
I'm I'm a like generally try time with me
I feel like
you've definitely been down here over an hour
but I mean we swam for 15 minutes by by itself
so yeah I'd say so that that makes sense
alright uh
so I'm gonna say that Sudara does have vision
and will make a ranged attack on the closest one
that has been damaged uh
that is a success
he's gonna roll damage
there's a arrow lodged into the like front
an eyeball here
and we're back up at the top of the mountain
alright havoc is gonna move into the group here
oh we're just down to one huh
oh no there's five of them
I see them all now I see them all now
oh shit oh shit
well boys and girls um
I wish I had something that was more than just a
one creature attack
but sorceress first we do
and it is a miss is a nine is a miss
uh
that guidance is gone right
we already said that a long time ago
it only last like a minute
yeah oh yeah
uh I've got nothing else okay
so Kayla
alright um
so these creatures are up 12 feet in the air correct
yes
something like that alright
um
I think I'm going to go ahead and make a javelin attack
yeah um
at yeah
this one hopefully we hit it
that's a hit
awesome and then do quick damage
this is my normal hit
uh
a seven yep
uh
this gazer you like you're throwing the javelin or your
yep okay
yeah uh
you uh
like aim up uh
everybody's been aiming for this front one
uh describe your throw
uh pretty much like Pierce this thing and
uh it comes to the ground
you've already seen one of these die before
that just kind of like ends in a dusty dream
uh but yeah
how's your how's your throw
like what's it look like
uh Caitlin just kind of leads with the shield
like aims with the shield
and then immediately rockets the javelin to kill it
and then as it falls he will use his movement
and run over
and grab the javelin from the dead creature
and continue chasing the other ones
yep alright
stop right there for me uh yep
as you uh
step out from this corner
uh a very large
almost 8 foot tall creature uh
takes a wild swing at you
oh shit
okay oh uh
let me add him to the mix here
uh he's gonna take an action now
and then he's gonna fall into the combat order
sure
uh he does get a
that's definitely gonna hit
oh sorry
this is his initiative uh
so for the next round uh
he has a uh
giant metal morning star that he swings
uh this is his attack roll against you
he does get a chance to do a second attack from
his abilities
and it looks like both of those are misses
alright yep
this uh
this creature is a bugbear
you've probably encountered them in your uh
excursions before he's like 8 feet tall
part orc part goblin
weird hybrid Fay creature
uh very unusual for you to find down here
yeah Caitlin will yell bug bear yeah
ambush where Bear Kate
oh there bear no
your turn to ask Bug Bear
um
I
when I have seen the attempted strike
oh from the bugbear
definitely saw a huge
cool mace come swinging from this alcove
uh I don't
maybe you can describe like
how you managed to dodge both these
Sir Kailyn but uh like
like this wild mace swing just comes
and he's maybe too tall for you
and you're just in time to duck under it
yep knock away with the shield
yeah
um and this one is dead correct
yes there is a dead one
okay I'm gonna remove him from the map
cause he just goes away
I'm gonna go
5 10
15
25 30
and then I'm going to try to make two
dagger attacks on this flying
uh uh
flying guy okay yeah
you uh
have gazer it's called line of sight into this bugbear
now he's just like this
like Hulk that is standing in this uh
alcove here yeah
I noticed it but these things kind of
kind of scare me so I'm gonna
oh nice
alright so this is our first true crit in combat
like first net 20 roll yes
uh I think we had one session two okay
if I'm not mistaken
but I think Aiden had one with the troll
yeah yeah
oh that's right
we did have one with the troll
alright so you max your dice roll
so what's your what's your dice roll
so it's a d 6 okay
so that would be 6 + 4 for 10
and then I just roll one more d 6
yeah cool
um I don't get
I don't have advantage for flanking on this guy
I'm assuming correct
yeah
okay cool yep
uh for three more
so 13 damage total on that first one
and this is the one like between you and Sir Kellen
right here yep
okay right there
I should have targeted it
that's my bad that's right
you said 13 in total yep okay
uh that kills this one outright
okay then in that case
cause I was right here so I went 5
5 10 15 20 25 I'm gonna take my other oh
I got a my other movement
I'm gonna go 30 here uh huh
if I go here
can Sir Caitlyn still attack him on his turn
or is he blocked
I'm gonna say that these 2 spaces can attack here
yes okay cool
then I will
I will make my bonus action attack on this bugbear okay
hmm
20:00 three twenty three is a hit nice little roll over
gotta love it oh
10 damage yeah
um and I will VEX this one
so he
I will have advantage on my next turn in the turn order
if he's not already deceased okay
but that ends my turn okay
it is a it is time to act
I think the initiative counter disappeared
I don't know if it's just on my side
no it definitely did okay
okay I can uh uh
the order is uh the Bugbear Havoc
Sir Caylin Cade Reneer
uh Mora the gazers and
and Sudara and we're at Renier right now
uh I don't
uh Renier
you can see it in the combat encounter
the cross swords uh
yes it's gone
thank you I forgot about that tab
uh alright
so reneer is gonna take a shot with his crossbow
on one of these
1 d 20+ four
uh he hits
1 d 1 d 8 + 4
oh nice
max damage
nice uh
this one that is above you
Sir Kailyn is uh like dripping blood
alright uh
Bora your turn to act
excellent
uh with fervor
I will attempt to grab my token correctly in advance
you said 12 feet in the air yeah
this guy Ben
can has
alright the one that's like uh
nearly done or one of the other ones sorry
oh um
he won he looks pretty in the rear
this guy gotcha
the one that looks pretty rough
it looks like it might kill over on its own
yes
alright he's making a wisdom saving throw here
12 damage hate that for him
it's fun though for me
I know alright
5 damage uh
to this uh
gazer that's been tormenting your party
uh it is yes
the game has turned to act
uh
they are going to move immediately back to like
as far as they can get in this tunnel
kind of like something like this
uh let me sorry
there we go that's how I want them to be
uh so that they can still see you
uh
all three of them are going to go a frost ray on Cade
like they're all in unison
you need to make a 3 DC twelve
uh saving throws
uh dexterity saving throws sorry
okay that's a success I need two more
that's a success I need a one more
okay uh
that's also success okay
you succeed all three of these like
uh
maybe you feel this like
burst of energy coming in your direction uh
but this like uh white
uh like cold emission
like they kind of like
try to like focus all of their attacks together on you
uh and you were able to uh
move out of the way just as uh
it strikes the ground where you were standing
uh and then we are at yeah
oh sorry
I was muted the entire time I was rolling those
I was like oh sorry
I I would imagine a
Kade would kind of do the Leon Kennedy backflip from
RE4 where he kind of runs up the wall a bit
and just kind of backflips over all three of the rays
and then lands back where he was nice I like it
alright I don't uh
shit I think I just reloaded again
uh it's gonna take me a second here
uh it's Sudara's turn to act after uh Cade um
here we go I'm loading back in just a second
do we think that Sudara would have enough
range to uh
shoot these things
I think he would definitely be coming forward
now at this point knowing that there's a bug bear
I mean I think the bow has like 120
max range so yeah
he would definitely definitely in this alright
uh I'm gonna say that he gets uh
within range for short bow attack for sure
uh that is a miss
oh actually thirteen
13 is a hit uh
he's going to go for the uh
very defeated one
and that one will be dead with his bow shot
nice alright
uh top of the order this is the Bug Bear's turn to act
he uh has a um
let me see
uh
he's gonna double attack you with his morning star Cade
okay
14 that misses
oh that also misses oh
it was like on the 20 for a moment
okay
havoc
he's kind of pinned in this corner here with you
in front with you and Sir Cailin in uh in his face
alright let's see
so I don't see the bug bear yet
um I'm 5 10 15
20 25
I think I get right there
um
this guy's still left there
I can't see the bug bear so I'm just gonna yeah
take a shot of this guy Sorcerer's
first
there's only two gazers up there remaining
yeah that's a hit
something cool no
probably really need to kill those things
yeah they're gonna definitely go back and alert
and then I'll end my turn okay
so Caleb it's your turn to act
all right uh
gonna knock the bug bear prone
go ahead and do a athletics check here contestant
he has to be a 20 dirty 20
all right let's see
oh man my rolls
oh yeah my rolls have been ticking awesome so hard
all right um
then gonna go ahead and give him a good old smack
right here yeah
you uh
at advantage yup
17 hits yeah
absolutely right
OK then
uh normal damage
OK
Woohoo nice 14 yeah
uh you've bashed this guy prone
he's kind of like backed into this uh
alcove that he was hiding in
uh he's like stumbled back to his feet
and you're kind of like dog pile on him at the moment
uh alright
that's my turn thank you okay
all right
I'm going to make a psychic blade attack on this prone
enemy yes uh
so this will be with advantage
uh okay
there's the first one uh
that is a miss
yep and here's the second one for advantage
oh boy uh that's a miss
target um
let me check this ability real quick
I don't think it works with
I'm just gonna remind you
you have pool inspirations that nobody has used any of
yet
how many do we have 5
use it use it use it
use it yeah
um it'll yeah
I'm gonna use it
you'll redo one of your advantage rolls
okay
come on
alright I think that hits OK cool
yeah
alright so that'll be another 10 from
the psychic
just base and then the extra damage from this thing uh
so that is 10 + 4 so 14 and then my sneak attack
damage which
oh sorry I'm
I'm sorry it's advantage
not a crit so no
it's not 10 it's four plus uh
four plus 4 8 damage
8 damage my bad
okay yeah
I was getting sneak attack and so 10 crit mixed up
8 damage that's what I understood
no just
just 8 the 10
the 10 was um
in it yeah
so 8 + 8 16 total
okay on that guy
uh is he still up
uh he is uh
still alive uh
he's prone yep
I mean he's yeah
knocked down in this corner
yeah okay
then I will turn and throw my second dagger
with my bonus action at this gazer over here okay
that probably hits 24
you're doing the one on the right out of this group yes
yep okay
and then 1 d 6 + 4
uh 4 6 damage
okay got it
yeah you
uh slash at this uh
bug bear on the ground and you kind of like
kicks maybe
your hand as you kind of
try to stab at him
with this dagger that you've just summoned
and you're like ah
forget this guy he's gonna be taken care of
and you spit around
and throw your dagger at one of these
things that's floating away from you now currently
uh yep
alright it is Reneer's turn to act now
uh he's down the hall
but he's got his uh crossbow
uh he is reloading crossbow uh
and firing again
1 d 20+ four
oh he misses
yeah
uh Mora
it is your turn to act
alright let's see
come up here a little bit
there's two left these two right
yeah yep
that one and that one right
both have been damaged yep
both have been damaged yep alright
then
I'm gonna drop
spiritual weapon
nice
right here yeah
um
I think I can't draw something
uh yeah
it should give you the option to like place something
if not I can
we can make a
I'll get you a token for it when we do that
there there's something
I'm not sure that that works with my color
versus the color of that water
but it is what it is
yep uh
cool
um so it springs to life and then as a bonus action
uh
only on my later turns right
yeah OK
if it's within 5 feet
yeah you can move it on yeah
later turns
but you can attack it looks like immediately
okay great so then
I see you do that
uh this guy
normal attack roll yep
17 hits 17 hits
cool
it takes 11 damage and you're on the one on the left
yes this one here
yes okay yeah
it's a like what is this
spiritual weapon that you've just summoned
and what does this look like as this thing like
gets popped out of the hover state that it's in
it is a giant um French forger's hammer
which means it has a large
round flat surf hammer surface in the front
and a 45 degree cutting spike on the rear okay
and it comes crashing down into this gazer
foolage in it into my will
and this
it's like like the strike of a hammer on an anvil
this thing is just like immediately dusted upon it
this hit
alright and then it fades into this uh dream here
uh it is the last gazer's turn
do you get a reaction with that weapon
it is it has its own turn order
according to it you create a floating
spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice
and lasts for the duration
the force appears
within range of the space of your choice
you can immediately make that attack
alright and on bonus action
you can make an attack so I think because you just
it counts as creature attack
uh alright
but it didn't didn't have like a prepared reaction
I think reaction would come into play if you didn't uh
you didn't use your action more likely yes uh
but you can also trigger reaction I
I'm gonna say yeah
let's I'm gonna let you swing this thing again
as this gazer tries to fly by
as it's like trying to escape up this way
as a final stop of these things
potentially getting away from you roll it again
all right
I see what you were trying to do
I'm gonna give you the the benefit here
oh yeah
alright uh
I don't even need you to roll for damage
it's definitely gonna kill this thing
but I want to absolutely max damage
max damage
let's go
alright
so yeah this uh
this uh
final gazer as all of the other ones were uh
annihilated by the uh group
it uh tries to float away your uh hammer
uh reacting according to your will
just smashes through the first one
and as this one floats by
it smashes through this second one uh
eliminating the gazers here
the only uh
combatant that remains is this bugbear who's uh
prone in the alcove that he was in
I think Sudara would move forward just to uh
try to get a better look at what's going on
he'd probably have a bow ready
uh but I don't think he could get a clean shot
between you two on the bugbear
so he doesn't take it uh
that one in his turn
bug bears turn he is going to stand up
that will take his movement
and then he is going to multi attack Morning Star
Morning Star at uked once again for standing in his way
uh first one is a 15
second one is a 21 uh
the 15 misses the 21 does hit okay
you take uh 13 hit points of damage
okay
and that is the end of his havoc it's your turn
alright
I do wanna acknowledge I think it's
we are really close to end of session time here
uh
so probably this combat end will end the session here
just so we're aware
how's the Bug Bear looking
he looks like he's pretty much done for yeah
you can kind of peek in between Sir Cailin and uh
Cade they've got him
like they've been stomping on him in this alcove
for a moment
um I'm gonna actually
can I try to engage him and see if he's willing to uh
to uh
give up and maybe we can question him see what's
see what's ahead of us do you talk to him in Goblin
I do okay
only does anybody else speak Goblin
nope okay
nope only
only you two are understanding what's being said here
um
clearly this is not the uh
this is not quite going your way
and I don't see you coming out of that corner uh
in one piece with with with my friend Cade here
I think what are your thoughts on
on holding your sword and
and giving it or holding your morning star and
and giving us a chin wag
let's let's see if we can't find some common ground
maybe you leave here uh
not in a uh in a body bag
and we get some information to know what's ahead of us
uh yeah
you give a give a persuasion here
oh my gosh persuasion perfect
something good oh yeah
yeah alright
no doubt you guys have the upper hand on this bug bear
uh
and although his uh companions were aberrations
this man is uh this bugbear is very much immortal
and understands that his time is fleeting
if he uh
decides to fight you any further here
uh I think that he would like
like have his weapon readied
but he's like
alright little man I'm willing to talk
where have they taken
oh my God Fleebel
what's his name I just forgot it
and who flun
Fleebel is way better though
yeah sorry
sorry uh
uh
flun we're
we're we're on our way down here looking for flun
obviously there's more of these ahead of us
but what can you tell us of what we have to face
yeah that uh
uh bugbears like uh you
you expect that there's more goblins somewhere nearby
if there's a bugbear uh
and he immediately uh
reveals he's like
uh there's uh
goblins in the uh
windows that will snipe you upon your approach
uh you'll probably find the door locked
uh I don't have the key
uh it's locked from the inside
uh and he gestures like he kind of like
will like show you with his hands
it's like it's you'll
you'll come to a like a t fork with a door on one side
uh and there will be a uh
the door will be locked uh
is is essentially what he reveals
but he says uh
is he being on can I
does he look like he's being honest with this
give an insight
and yeah I'll let anybody make an insight here too
uh as he's spouting
do we know what he's
we don't know what he's saying though
oh yeah
that's right right
true true true
thank you darn
uh you uh
I I'll say that you're like
uh pretty con
confident that what he's describing
in Goblin to you is uh
uh
truthful havoc more
you got a
the same feeling through his grunts that you understand
those grunts are truthful um
is there anything else any
is there is there
oh what rule is it
never go through the front door
rule No. 12 never go through the front door
is there a back way
uh to get through this
to avoid being sniped by the goblins
uh he's like I
I don't know of any back way I guard the front way
um he's kind of brutish and his
uh talk here
I'm gonna whisper to Cade to knock him out if I can
and then we're just I
I I wanna search him okay
but I just wanna incapacitate him
I don't wanna kill him
um
yeah and uh
Kate will kind of uh
in it to his best ability um
we'll kind of just try to do like a straight
like jab to his face to knock him out
alright yeah
I'm I'm not gonna role play you
fighting him down from his current hit points
I'm gonna say that yeah okay
you just have the ability to knock him out because he's
and I'm gonna communicate everything that he told me uh
in Goblin to the group
just to help prepare us for the next uh
for next week or in a couple weeks when we come back
yep uh
alright he's got a small heavy sack uh
in it is a 29 gold pieces
uh there's a cheap looking Garnet
uh and it looks like uh
he's got uh
a greasy sack with some rations
uh there's a water skin filled with a murky
ale smelling liquid
uh he's got a
uh key ring with three large rusty keys
uh and he's got a collection of small items
that he's likely bullied off
other lesser goblins uh
like a knuckle bone like a kobold's uh like
like a collection of like shinies
like pebbles and then a uh
single well made weather glove that it
leather glove that is like way too far
like way too small for him
OK I'll pick up the gold sack immediately
upon knocking him out and kind of uh
toss it back to havoc yeah
um to kind of disperse out to the group
um and I guess yeah
I'll take the glove
I'm gonna see the glove and I'll pocket it
yeah that's all I'll take
it's a nice leather glove
uh I
like I said when you dawn magic items
you would know the effects immediately
doesn't seem like there's anything
special about this glove it's just a nice single
like we're gonna say it's a right handed nice
well made leather glove
so it fits you nicely though
if it if it looks
if it looks clean enough Cade will
Cade would put it on yeah
this guy uh
it was like a trinket like
you know certainly he kept some care of these things
yeah yeah
he'll he'll put the glove on and yeah
and step away alright
uh alright
combat has ended this guy's in unconscious
uh I just want to confirm
you're pressing forward given the knowledge of goblins
uh potentially ambushing from windows above
when you get to the t intersection right
that's that's where we're at
yep yep yep
alright uh yep
cool cool
uh I'm gonna call this end of session tonight
uh you've got a little bit further to go to
obviously uncover what's going on
I really appreciate you guys
I'm sorry that Sudara couldn't be here
he did message me at some point
so hopefully he'll be in the next one
and we can have him going
but just want to go around
you know what went well
what could go better give me that
I think overall everything went
went well went like we explored the dungeon
um the combats were
were good fought out um
planned ahead of time so that was
that was good um
I don't think anything really went
went wrong so yeah
good job anything I can do better
I mean I
I I say it's easy to say a lot went well
but I mean um
I wonder is there or I'm sorry
keep going my bad
no the
the only
the only thing I would say is it
it seemed at the beginning of session
um energy was a little low
but then it ramped up towards
towards like as we got chugging along
um but at the beginning I was
there was certain parts where I was like
did my audio reset and like
is he like super quiet and then I checked
and you were at 1:60 online on discord um
but yeah it was very minor thing
and I only really just kind of noticed it
but okay yeah
yeah let me know if I need to turn my input up overall
I can I can do that on the back end
so you don't have to max me like that
yep alright
anybody else I almost mentioned that to you too um
you started out quieter than normal
when I hear you on here but I
I knew just to turn you up a little bit
sorry it's
it's
your microphone is very sensitive to your positioning
yeah um
I noticed I gotta
so pull it in closer to my face sometimes sorry
oh yeah
that sounds much
that sounds way more like what I remember here
I end up like pushing it up above my mouth
and so when I talk it it's not in line with my mouth
but when I have it here yeah
sorry if uh
if ever that happens just be like
yo microphone
I I
I hate to leave it here though
cause sometimes I'm like a
I'm a mouth breather and when I get real excited
you're gonna hear me mouth breathing too so sorry
uh I
I got something yeah
DM if you don't mind uh
I noticed a couple of times
on certain people's abilities
some stuff is still like not in your system like uh
whenever Cade rolls it's him doing like the hand roll
yeah I think uh
going through some of that stuff
and getting it corrected is
is probably better yeah
uh needs to be better
and then also combat flow
uh definitely improving um
but I would say with the group enemies
we kind of lagged behind a bit
I don't mind the talking between people's turns cause
you know I love the roleplay
but there was some of that too
um so if we could get some of that down
that'd be great yup
um but otherwise um
great session thank you
cool yeah
I take some blame for the ability
cause when I leveled up I thought everything was good
and I didn't like talk with him about like
whether or not my stuff actually rolled correctly
so yeah we can clean that up this uh
before next session alright
yeah I will uh
I will definitely police on uh
anybody uh
talking during other people's turns
so uh
just let's be aware of that too
to improve things
anybody else
Mora Havoc
no no
I'm good cool Mora
just validation I think I'm good cool
alright y'all I
I feel bad for the guy who missed the
the turn he did well in that hand to hand combat
so thank you guys yeah
for letting me listen in uh
I'm working along with my brother too
