anybody else have any issues they need to uh
address before we get in into this
nope I'm good
we talking about game issues or life issues
what kind of issues game
game specific let's go game specific at the moment
not not issues but did you see my DMS
um I sent you a couple of links
got got some of that I made your
and cheat changes
sweet
yeah
the other ones I looked at as further down the line uh
yeah I figured yeah
Tonight's game sponsored by Better Way Health
sign up for counseling on Better Way Health
alright I'm gonna try to shut up and be uh
the silent observer again
but thank you guys again I appreciate it
it's been a good exposure to it and so far I
I know the guy who I don't know everyone's names yet
but the guy who is the monk um
when the group was with you
it was definitely the coolest thing that I've seen
so far uh
in my exposure to D&D
so thanks for letting me tag along
so that would be my character um
my name is Doug or Chaser um
I was busy with work last time around
so yeah I'm glad you get to see what he did
I didn't well I think it was super cool
the summaries are a cool way to recap
and I think that was um
hopefully it did it justice
I didn't read that part
but it was a interesting moment and the group did well
they even rped you it was nicely
nicely done yeah
I I thanked everybody when I logged in
that's the way it should be
and you can roll up a character too dude
um with the DM's permission
we had we had talked about that
so I um
I've been mostly learning and helping that
you know he's my brother
so he's gotten me into it
as with most things
my brother's dragging me along into it
but uh
we talked about that and unfortunately I have a little
like he's got a little bit of the storyline
planned out in advance
and so I don't think it would be right for me to have
like prior knowledge
um it's like I've watched I've
I've seen too far ahead so only um
if we continue the story beyond that
it would make sense for me to join in
I think but so far it's
so far it's good
and I'm learning to help behind the scenes with DM
so thanks again I understand that completely
and I'm gonna stop talking so we can get started
but one of the things you'll learn
is the difference between player knowledge
and character knowledge
I know a little bit about the original um
module that we're playing
I don't know what um
Severus has done uh
change wise
but my character only knows what my character knows
okay and sometimes it's hard
to separate the two
but an experienced player should be able to do that
yeah duck
that's a that's actually a great point
like these modules
in some cases have been out for 10+ years
and people have played them multiple times
it's all about what your character knows
you might know something and to be fair
if like you're metagaming something
I usually be like hey DM
I'm not trying to meta game
but I know about this thing or
or whatever so I mean
it's a common thing but I understand
hello hello yay
alright hey man yay
we're at a uh
corn stupid Wendell's haha
where a quorum uh
progress then uh
if everybody's good I'd say we uh
jump into it
since we're just a couple minutes behind here now
if that's right
your mic
your mic might be a little far from your mouth again
thank you check
yep yep
sweet cool better
thank you for that much better yep
it's in my it's literally in my notes to do now
so as I was gonna get back into my notes
I was gonna check that here
so thank you uh
I actually have some fun stuff too
I can uh play some music now too
oh so check uh
Jockey Music
the user that just joined and make sure that you're
oh yeah user's volume is
a comfortable level for everybody to speak over
and just play quietly in the background
hey we're at a full party now too cool
uh you haven't missed anything
we are we were waiting on a sound
mic issue and just discussing game uh overall
so you haven't missed anything
yeah I'm just loading here
okay cool
alright so you left off at the end of last session
your party incapacitated a bug bear guard
along with his gazer group uh
you were able to eliminate every single gazer
in addition with
obtaining some information about the
upcoming passage that you will find yourself
trekking into
uh kind of fortress situation
there's a potentially locked door with uh
sniper windows covering the entrance to this
like sewer fortress that you find yourselves uh
headed towards
and uh
as you press deeper into the water deep sewers
following Xanathar's guild's faded
crude yellow markings the passage narrow
the air grows even fouler
thick with the damp
ancient stench of the city's underbelly
following information
forcefully extracted from the bugbear
you pass an open access to an unknown basement
with a staircase
and I'll activate here
yeah this music is gonna be huge
I appreciate it yeah
are you able to turn it down just a smidgeon for me
I you can turn it down on your end um
if you right click on the jockey music
thank you yeah
then you'll have you'll have a volume
user volume that you can shift user specific
I got it yep go
yep
then it will that will maintain over future sessions
too you'll just adjust accordingly
alright thank you so much
yep so I've got you loaded in the order that we were in
kind of tramping through the sewers last session
uh and I will unpause the game here
I'll pause if you get to anything worthy of review
all right um
I would say we're proceeding kind of cautiously um
trying to be on the lookout for things
we're not trying to speed through the source
yeah
so trying to remain perceptive for any kind of traps or
uh anything that can be perceived as a threat
yeah uh
I would like to kind of tap on uh
on uh
Caledon's um
like shoulder as we're walking Paladin ah
sorry what did I say Kaylin
Kaylin one word I
it's like a it's like a mixture of
of Kaylin and Paladin so actually that's pretty cool
of a Kailyn shoulder pad and I kind of uh
will say to him in a in a hushed voice uh
like uh hey uh
uh
Kailyn do you uh
do you happen to have any uh
any more of that uh
holy healing uh
and I kind of like lift my left hand from my like
like below my right chest and there's like a
a gash
like a gash Mark from the Bug Bear Club that hit me
you like a I
I took a took a pretty bad hit
I I can track on if you don't have it
but you know I'm not at 100%
I have certain gifts yes
I can
I can help you and then Caitlin will uh
turn around put a
a hand on his friend's shoulder
and then use his healing hands nice
oh nice roll
I mean
I didn't mean to do that sorry
I'm trying to look see what a mirror image yeah
that's the description I mean
sweet
um yeah
I uh
the wound kind of kind of closes a bit um
there's still a couple of bruise marks uh
where the wound was um
but I kind of like move my right shoulder back like uh
okay yeah
that's that's much better
uh appreciate it
the dawn father provides
and then Galen continues to walk
um
I just I want to make sure that I understand
how the mirror image works okay uh
and I it's not letting me read this yeah
so basically mirror image you
when you cast it for 1 minute
you have 3
you have three like illusory duplicates of yourself
and when an enemy goes to attack you
you roll the d 6 if it is 3 or above
then they attack your duplicate
not you and then once they attack the duplicate
it vanishes so you have three charges of it
and then either you lose all three charges
and then the spell's gone
or after a minute the spell will
will go away
if they attack you and they don't hit your duplicate
then you still have all three gotcha yeah
I'm just gonna remind everybody that we uh
our habit is gonna remind everybody
that
they specifically said that they have a trap up here
like we know that we're walking into a bunch of goblins
so um
you know if you have anything that might help with that
just um
I do want to
do want to remind you did have light cantrip active
did you want to continue to have light on
as you progressed in here
cause I I do have some interesting effects okay
alright yeah
whoever whoever needs that yeah
yeah okay
I do have the ability to I can reapply it if I need
I do have the ability to drop that as like
an active effect on people now so he's got that as a
it you should be
so we're late
currently we're walking into where a bunch of um
goblins are
yes
tentatively that's what they
that's what the bug bear said
understood um
I have the ability to drop darkness um
on an area
um
it's magical and I don't think that people with um
dark vision would be able to see
um that might help us
I don't wanna do that without
discussing it with the party first yeah
darkness is a bit of a
darkness is great in the right moment
but outside of that
it fucks a lot of people to be straight up with you
maybe we can plan on using that as a meter retreat
that's probably a good thing to kind of cast
in front of us
is we just kind of run full tilt behind us
if we need to
I can also
I can also cast um minor illusion
so we can create a distraction as we move in and um
surprise the goblins
I also press to did the chip that one so uh
if we get if we can see these guys ahead of time
let's try to distract as best we can
I guess would be the plan
are you listening for anything in particular
or like just slowly moving into this uh
hub here
um listening for chatter of got goblins or um
like anything that we can perceive as a trap
yeah I'm also looking ahead to see if there's any
odd shadows or shade that way of
you know I'm imagining
that if they're looking through those little portholes
if they have candles or something behind them
maybe that'll give us some insight
so just kind of looking for dancing light or something
that might tell us where these portholes are
yeah the arrows murder slots are not hard to pick out
as you approach this large central circular hub
there's two passages that continue north into the east
there's a stone door set into the back wall
on the stone ledge to the west
and you note the pair of arrow slits
carved into the northwest
and southeast outer walls
as you approach Kaylin Cade Havoc
I would think that you're close enough
you hear the rhythmic kind of
as you approach
they
at least one of them seems to be asleep
I have a
I quietly tell the party that I have a suggestion
I have no armor
I could probably stealthily sneak in and um
subdue him
so the uh windows
the arrow slits are no wider than
like 2 inches in width they're pretty tall several
several inches in height
but you can see that there's a couple kind of uh
around the circular nature of the hub here
both sides
probably about 10
12 feet off the ground with like aiming down
I don't think that you would be able to
sneak in through the slits unless you could um
morph yourself there's a door
yeah there's a door somewhere else and I'm not able to
yeah I got it
no I would like to kind of approach
that slit and kind of peer inside and see what I see
okay yeah
make a stealth check as you approach that slit for me
then alright
this should be decent for me
does anybody have guidance
we have a cleric don't we
yeah 19 yeah
19 for sure uh
just so you're aware this is
you have the slits here like okay
this way and then this way
yeah OK OK
yeah so I'll
I'll kind of go over here to this one yeah
and you pull yourself up uh
attempt to look through yeah
okay I'm gonna just give you a glimpse
I think I can do this
uh
I'm just gonna drag your character through the wall
just to see what you see for a moment here
alright okay
there's two goblins and are they both sleeping
yeah one is like asleep with a bow in his hand uh
like right near the window
right near these murder holes
this is probably the one that you can hear most active
the other one seemed to be
like a makeshift bed of sorts on some sacks in the yeah
room yeah
uh what's
what's your ruling for like
taking down a sleeping enemy are
are like
do you do you still have to do full
like the full HP value or because they're sleeping
is it more like you can kind of sneak
like automatically sneak attack
kill them uh
yeah I mean
you get you get a surprise round at advantage
OK and it's crit because they're
it's auto crit because they're sleeping
uh OK
and then you'll get a
a regular combat round against them
and then they'll roll initiative
okay um
I would like to
I'm gonna kind of sneak away from those slits okay
um and get back to the group real quick um
I'm gonna flourish my hands and make two of those of my
like psychic shadow daggers appear
yeah um
and be like so
there's two goblins
uh in this room sleeping uh to the right
um
I what I've noticed from these daggers
that I can conjure is that when I hit
when I attack with them it doesn't actually cut them
uh it just seems to like damage their interior
I may be able to
to get one of them while they're sleeping
by throwing two of these blades through the slits
or holy we think that casting darkness
it sounds it did it we heard them snoring right
sounds like they're sleeping they are sleeping
what if we cast darkness around the windows
and we just snuck through where we needed to go
well casting the darkness would probably alert them um
that we are that we're around
we might just be better off sneaking past them
if we're all confident in our ability to move quietly
I kind of I kind of look at Kaylin
I kind of look at Kaylin and uh um
and Moira as I say that
hold on just around let us pray together
just so you guys know
darkness for me isn't like the spell darkness
I basically summon from shadowfell
if that makes sense as a shadow monk
so I can I can create darkness
and then I'll have to concentrate on it
like the spell and then I can dispel it at will
so um we can throw it in there or not um
it's gonna be totally up to you guys
are you able to see through this darkness yourself
um yes
um well
it's gonna take a DM ruling
if we're using 2024 rules for the monk yes
but I'm gonna defer defer to the the DM on that
let me confer your sheet here
you have dark vision up to 120 feet
with your monk abilities I believe
correct but um
so when you cast this darkness though
is it just something that you cast in the middle
it sounds like if they're all sleeping
and we think that they're sleeping
does your casting darkness make a noise or anything
or does it just magic component
that's what I thought okay
yeah I don't know
I feel like
I feel like if you cast it kind of towards the middle
and we well
now it blinds out it darkens for us
but other people can see into it
alright it doesn't matter
it looks like where you guys decide yeah
it looks like Cedar can see through it specifically
uh it doesn't say in particular if other users
if other players can go through it as well
I've only confirmed that the
that the guys on our right are sleeping
I'm not sure about the slits up to
like the left of this circular room
they might be awake and if they are
it might make it
advantageous to use the darkness on them
not the sleeping ones and then just dart past them
we could also check this door right here oh
right here and see if that leads maybe around
do you actually check that door
I'm just saying it right now okay
uh bring it up like that
we haven't checked it yeah
we could also check that door
and see if it leads around to like
the outside where the slits actually connect to okay
I wanna ask we've been deliberating for a moment
I'm gonna need some stealth rolls
I wanna just confirm are you at
are you standing at that door deliberating
or would you have been
a little further back in the tunnel
as far as you could have been
uh avoiding any possible detection
the second option okay
then I don't need any specific stealth rules
at the moment
checking this door isn't a bad idea
and when we're ready
I can position myself on the other side of the door
ready to cast darkness if need be
the archers aren't gonna be able to see us through it
is there a way for us to get into these
and incapacitate them further
like while sleeping are they incapacitated
does that give the incapacitated condition
what what would give the incapacitate
uh incapacitated
does sleep give people the incapacitated
like if you're asleep do you
are you considered unable to take reactions and actions
uh because they're already asleep
are they incapacitated that's actually a great question
I don't know uh let me look into that
okay
uh
Google saying yes okay
the state
of sleep is considered to be the unconscious condition
which includes the incapacitated condition
this means a sleeping creature cannot take actions
bonus actions or reactions okay there's your answer
good to go good to go I
I think we're free to move cautiously
if we want to use darkness
uh go for it
but you will have to lead us
I can make sure that it's well where do we wanna go
cause I can put it where it's not in our way
like I can put it in the room
I can put it over here in the far corner
um
yeah guys
I think somebody's gonna make a decision
do we wanna try to go into their room
and actually attack these guys
I feel like our better choice
would be to try to sneak past them
if we can but coming back
we're gonna have to address them either way
so I'm fine with taking them on right now
so let's
let's examine this door and go through the door and
what I'll do when the time comes is position myself
like right here and be prepared to cast darkness
in our defense
somebody with the door examining ability I would say
um'cause out of character
I I don't know if I know what a rogue and thief are
but no um
so somebody uh who can examine the door
let's let's do that and I'll I'll sign guard and
I'll do a slide of hand to lock pick it um
I'd look towards havoc when the deliberation is like
who's gonna try to open the door um
that because you opened up the warehouse door um
it's kind of like yeah
I'm gonna go up to it I'll check it yeah
uh go ahead and make a
what are you gonna do slight of hand
uh double with a stealth roll
anything that you do with the door here
so I'm gonna move in position
and I'd also like to still
that's my boy roll the guidance too
yeah don't forget your guidance
um
so 21 so do I also need to throw a stealth
yes well
I need a stealth check here
as you're tinkering with the door
oh oh
I think slide a hand first alright
14 for stealth yeah
and then 21 decks are stealth yeah
and then roll a D4 for guidance and apply that
I would apply to the lowest one
yeah I'm going to the great call D4
nope at the D6 D4
yeah yeah
big money yeah uh
you'll add that to your stealth check Sudara
you kind of move forward into position
everybody's kind of positioned around havoc to uh
bust into this door here uh
he settles into I find a hand with a 21 yeah
you settle into lock picking here and uh
it takes just a moment for you
but you're uh
grim that's flashed to the party as
become a kind of signature
of yours as you've gotten into this door here
now as well
click it unlocks
oh oh
it won't unlock no
it doesn't oh sorry
yeah I need to actually change the lock just a second
okay
do you just push the door open
no so once I unlock it
I'd like to I'm gonna listen at the door
I just wanna see if I can hear the
the snoring in this room directly to the door yeah
you don't you don't hear snoring in the door uh
directly that you've just unlocked
alright I'm gonna
I'm gonna I'm gonna slowly open the door
slowly pushing it and I'm
I'm kind of trying to look around as I do
and slowly ease into it as you push the door uh
a bell from somewhere within side the room rings ding
ding ding ding ding
like you've uh uh
pulled on some sort of trip wire pushing the door open
uh as loosely as you have uh
you hear uh
from the windows uh
like a boot shifting on grit uh
a moment later a guttural voice hisses
the sound strangely echoey in the chamber Oy
who's there
um
have we seen any I'd like to use prestidigitation
wait does it
can I make a sound with prestidigitation
no yeah
you can I can um
can I make can I try to make the sound of rats
like kind of
yeah like the
the scurrying of the rats in the tunnel right
yeah alright
uh does everybody uh
upon hearing the voice
try to make their movement into this room
or you stay and put
stay in put stay in put yeah
I'd I'd probably back up against this wall
instead of just standing out there
but yeah I'd be like back against the wall
so Daryl
stand fast and probably be the last one into the room
if need be yeah
I think Renier would move against the wall here too
kind of hearing the voices uh
you you hear that same voice that shouted out Oi
who's there he's like
listen up I got four bows on you
don't care who you are this is Anathar's turf
get your bellies in the MUD hands where we can see him
one wrong move and we'll turn you into pin cushions
and you can see some arrows
poke out through some of the slits
well shit boys um
when I when I made that noise
I mean does that trigger the trap
am I able to like fully open the door now
or is it kind of like yeah
so if I open it more it's gonna make more noise
no your the click was for you unlocking the door
there was no particular trap
the the
the real trap was the
they have a trip wire to a bell on the door
that you've triggered
okay but once I open that door
that trigger is done
like I can if I need to run into that room
I can yep
I'm gonna I'm gonna step into that room okay
uh alright
hold on a second though cause uh
it I okay
is anybody reacting specifically to their commands of
get down on your bellies
no I was gonna ask
so you said that you
we can see some arrows poking through the wall correct
yeah like these are like
you know arrow slits of like 2 inch width you
you know you can see the
the points of their arrows poking through now
yeah
um the only thing I would like to do
um is I would like to
I would like to use my telekinesis um to basically
like tug on one of the arrows
that are poking through the slit
and have it kind of like
fall to the ground okay
like basically un unknock his bow okay um
alright so
I'm gonna give everybody the opportunity to move
and I'm gonna shoot whoever gets into the room
last year probably
so who's who's staying in that door to take the hits
uh Caitlin would probably go in right after havoc
protect him okay
DM I did say I would go last
you did say you would go last
I did I did say that you would go last
that I would go last before you talked about shooting
so gotcha if we're gonna
if we're gonna do an an entry into the room
you know like SWAT style
I'd be the last man
I'm basically at the moment I'm covering the rear
so we're gonna have to roll with that okay
cool alright
so yeah I'd go I'd go in after Kalin
um
alright so
it's gonna be Sudara and reneer
that end up probably taking shots here then uh
and uh you're gonna roll for me Cade
your mage hand uh attack disruption
so uh we'll say that's gonna be
you're gonna like try to grapple his weapon
we'll do a strength check on your well
I mean how does that work for your hand
um the mate
it's so I can just lift up to 5 pounds with it okay yes
so you can just pull it probably no problem
yeah okay
alright I will do a strength check for him to see how
well he reacts on that then okay
yeah I think
I think you're able to yank the
the bow and at least the arrows free from his uh
grip on the uh knocking alright
so uh
everybody can move the
archers are basically gonna take one shot at you here
as you uh
move into cover and let's see how they come out here
oh
was nobody else going into the room
I was gonna wait till after these first yeah
so Sudar that one would have been on you
and then there's a second one on you
and then the third one will be on reneer
alright so first
first
one was a critical with the 24 second one was a 9
so that's gonna be a miss uh
and then let me do damage
uh so that would be
no 12 damage on Sudara yeah
am I doing that right 13 damage cause it's a D6 sorry
13 damage with the critical and then this one on reneer
oh my gosh what the
that's problematic
alright so 10 damage on reneer
all right
and then reneer would move and get into the room here
all right Sudara
you're the last to move in and you uh
pull the door closed behind you
uh goblins are on high alert now at the moment
but uh
you're not exactly sure how this room connects through
let me remove some of my drawings
I'm gonna say uh
free to act here
the goblins are also kind of positioning
okay
I think you've had enough time
they've had enough time
I think Kate would like instinctively go to this door
and just check to see if it's locked as well
yeah this
this door the handle uh moves freely
uh
I'd like right
no
um I would kind of like peek it just a tiny bit
and then try to like
investigate to see if I see any traps
uh on this door
yeah uh
couldn't do an investigation for me then as you OK
uh 15
yeah you uh
know you're under some duress with the goblins
potentially setting up on the
other side of the door here
but you take a moment to look it over and no
nothing uh
nothing stands out as trapped from this side
cool um
yeah then I'd like
I guess like crack it open and see
not like a whole bunch
but like enough to kind of get like
like an eye through to kind of like
see what the other one looks like yeah
I'll give you the uh
the look here again
just we'll do this so you can see
okay
DM can you see these guys
yeah yeah
I can
yes sir
while that goes on I'm going to um
invoke my healer ability sure
I have the healer's kit
so I'm gonna use one and expend a dice okay
yeah
to uh
heal up
um
yeah Kate you
you peek your head around the corner here for a moment
and you can see the
potentially two goblins on this side
kind of lined up in a like sniper setup behind the
the nearest wall here
yeah they're uh
they're shouting in Goblin now at this point
definitely
a little terrified that you've already gotten in
yeah uh
I think for sure Cade would probably rush
rush them cause I think he's
he's made the assessment now that this room is
definitely where these slits are
just based on the layout and like
the dimension of how this room is set up
so I think after noticing that
he would try to
rush them to get the upper hand and like
get them while they're not expecting it okay
oh okay
but I don't know if we want to do that with like
initiative or
or how we want to do that with everyone else
what if I ran out really quick and acted like a goblin
because I'm a goblin and I said
I had you guys and at least like
got us in the room first
we will cover you
maybe we didn't go with you
yeah let me try something really quick Kate
just let me be the one to go first
and then that way when you rush
but
you're gonna have to say something to him in character
cause he's looked around the corner and he's like
positioned to run immediately
so I'm actually more like here still
oh I can't go there
I'm gonna run in like you're chasing me
yeah I'm like
I'm like right there yeah
looking around the corner just about to yeah
about to like dash and you
I think that you probably recognize this like
look
like my hands kind of twitching on like
the corner of the wall
so Havoc's gonna toss his
his hood back uh
he's gonna give Kate kind of a familiar look um
and he's gonna say uh
rule 17 when I can be a goblin
let me be a goblin and so uh
so I'm gonna run past you and I'm just going to kind
of scream almost more like I'm kind of
like just trying to get their attention
so I'm just gonna run past them
I'm gonna throw my hands wide um
and I'm gonna say in Goblin
uh
you know there's tons of them
there's tons of them
and I'm gonna kind of push past you kid
is that fair yeah um yeah
oh I see
give me a I'm ready
an action for if the goblins come around the corner
I'm throwing one of my shadow daggers at them
yeah uh
yeah hang on
I'll let you decide is this a persuasion or performance
your
I'll let you go either way here havoc as you run uh
you know kind of like hands up past these guys uh
persuasion please okay
yeah roll your persuasion here
oh I'm not 15
oh yeah uh
these these goblins are
you know in the heat of the moment
they see another goblin rushing past them
you know shouting there's a bunch of them they
they immediately drop their bows and start like
running with you they go like this way up the uh
up the staircase here running so soon as oh
they're like running away
oh yeah they're running yeah
they're running then I
then I would not throw it only if they ran towards me
yeah I should have clarified that
um
and what do I alright
so I'm following with them as we're running yeah
am I able to kind of see what's up
is this up or down these stairs
this is this is up
okay um
I'm gonna try to get before they get up the stairs okay
I have uh
I'll tell you how yes
in my pocket I have um
1,000 ball bearings oh nice
um
1,000 I'd like to grab a bunch of them
and I'd like to throw them at the stairs okay
yeah
um and as
and uh yeah
so that's what I'm gonna do yeah
just do a uh
improvised throw improvised weapon attack uh
which would be a thrown weapon
would be with your dexterity
and just draw on the map
like on the stairs where you're aiming
yeah so I'm kind of I yeah
so they're I'm gonna try to aim like
right up here
so that they kind of fall down the stairs
did you see that did that draw
no no I didn't see the drawing
yes or no no
I don't think oh
there we go yeah
I see it now yep
so that's the area that I'm just tossing them in okay
um and I need to just
you said just throw dexterity yeah
do it
do it improvised throw attack
which would be dexterity plus your or so be deck
well mod
real real question here
shouldn't you just be able to spread it out uh
for like a square area that's like 10 feet
yeah but I
I'm gonna make him roll because he's throwing
up a staircase
okay in in the heat of the moment
good to go yeah
oh yeah
the 17 definitely you can get these to where you want
uh up the staircase
you're able to uh
put these you know
against the back wall and they kind of
all kind of come pouring back down the
the stairs as and as they're falling on my God yeah
yeah and I'm just trying to get close to them um
at this point I would like to well
I
are we in like uh
initiative at all here or am I still I'm
I'm gonna roll and see where they end up here
with some dexterity saving throws
this guy ends up prone at the base of the stairs
this guy is able to scramble up halfway up the stairs
so this one is here
this one is prone at the base of the stairs
after falling back down
I'm gonna let you decide
has everybody else even stepped into the room now
at this point where are you at specifically
I'm gonna remove that other blue draw
I'll OK you got it
I'll be next into the room OK
coming in staying out of the way here okay
Mora Cade
Reneer Sudara
all can move into position here
and reneer would probably be in the doorway
I'm gonna
uh well
depending on what I
depending on what everybody else does here I don't know
I don't know if I attack her if I
alright uh yeah
you seen baby yeah
where were you chaos uh dad
so I'm going I'm
I'm gonna cast hold person to the one that got away
okay
I need to make a wisdom saving throw
I fail I'm paralyzed
and then I look at the one that's on the ground
you better shut up and you better stay still
and I look back at everybody to see like
obviously see if he's gonna do what I ask
and then see if everybody else is kind of with us yeah
you you already got the best of these guys
they thought you were a goblin of their tribe
we're fleeing with you and you rushed the room on them
they immediately threw down their shotguns
and headed for the stairs
and you uh
quick thinking
hooked your bag of ball bearings up the staircase
one of them uh proved to be pretty agile
but you grip him with your whole person uh
the the other one prone at the bottom of the stairs
kind of has his hands up already
he's like I'm
I'm not going anywhere ball bearings
still bouncing down the stairs around you
we can do this without people getting hurt
can't we guys now come on now and uh
I kind of see what everybody around me wants to do
now that we've got these guys
at least
um hold up yeah
I'm Morton
that was impressive Havoc
Puke himself would have been impressed
well done
how many are there on the other side guys
there's two over there too
yeah well
there's six in total here
uh he's like I
we haven't gotten any new word from our
our bugbear leader in some hours
but there the the dwarf down here
he asked uh
he asked for two of the guards to go
help him with the problem
in the lavatory
they haven't come back that's why we were sleeping
we've been on guard duty for hours it seems like
I mean
it sounds like you got some rotten bosses telling you
yeah shame it's a shame
well uh
well how about
how about you get your boys over on that side to
to come over here for a good snack and uh
do it so they don't come over here with their arms out
cause otherwise we might just have to
have to crack your necks too
you know
oh he's
he's like the only way I know is to go around
I don't know guys what do we think this
this laboratory uh
which direction is it oh
we were going in it
in the direction it's up these stairs through
through the rooms
uh can I inside check that yeah
go
yeah you don't oh
it was almost four yeah
you don't you don't uh
catch any sense of uh
like lying from the goblin here
they they recognize uh
that they're in a shit situation here
why don't we move closer into this room over here guys
that way uh
we've got some distance between us and this laboratory
you goblins
oh come back into this room yeah
I I was going to tie this guy up okay
at least the one that's not held by your spell
yep okay
um so I kind of from my
from my belt grab some rope and uh
fastened his arms and legs behind
like behind his back um
and then I think I'd even make a
like a gag from the rope too OK
just like something to go around his mouth um
just for the time being yeah
um and then secure him
and kind of escort him to where we're gonna go OK
yeah you can kind of tie him up and uh
gag his mouth and uh yeah
he still able to walk but uh
his hands and chest are bound
we should probably tie the one that I'm holding as well
just in case
yeah just uh
hold it a little bit longer
and I'll try to tiptoe around the
like the ball bearings yeah
um and tie this one up as well
you're not under duress now
so easy to move amongst the ball bearings
especially for your party now um
but yeah uh
he's still held and with that
you do tie them both up are they tied together
are these goblins tied together
no they're they're
they're separately tied yeah
alright just wanted to confirm here
if they try to run for it
I would move this one probably against this wall
and then this one right next to him
so they're both kind of along this wall of the stairs
okay let me uh just sort this here
um as we're kind of
as he's figuring this out
Havoc's wondering
eye notices that there's a little bit of uh
shinies down here in the corner
hey guys do uh
do you guys wanna go check the uh
the goodies out there
while we consider our next planner
I'm sorry goodies
haha
yes goodies
uh it's just kind of what he says um
like anything valuable is a goodie
um it was rule 18
uh have it
you can go look at that I'll
I'll stand by the uh
the goblins and Cedar is gonna
from his current position
keep an eye on the door that we came through down here
yeah um
basically Overwatch yep
uh could the goblins be moved on
like this flat floor instead of the stairs
just like yeah
right there and there that'd be yeah
I think I split that four ways
did everybody get it it looks like everybody got gold
okay
that's cool yeah
does anybody need a short sword
no I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna pick all this stuff up
yeah it was a
something I've been messing with is these item piles
on the ground you should be able to loot stuff
that you come across
it's a burglar pack
thanks
well guys
we've got some loot that we will track up for later
dagger and things
alright well
so if the laboratory is up the stairs
and those other goblins we can only assume are still
they're likely awake at this point
um it might be best just to
head up the stairs to that laboratory and see what
what that
the dwarf they were talking about is all about
agreed
we have a goblin that speaks goblin correct
yeah yeah
and they're not and they're not
I don't believe they've been alerted yet
so if we just we just captured two goblins
do we want to ask them if they know where um
whoever we're looking for is
oh yeah
ask away
let's do a pile what was his name
hold on a minute flun
flun yeah flun
I don't speak Goblin
so somebody else will have to do that
I don't speak Goblin either
rules I also do rule 17
no yeah
rule exactly
rule 17 yes
when I can be a goblin let me be a goblin
alright I'm gonna goblin it up
alright let's do
we're gonna go in
um
are those guys are those guys looking for us
or are they still distracted
I'm I'm talking to the goblins here
yeah they uh
they're like who
goblins on the other side
well we
we can normally communicate through uh
some hand signals out across the way but uh
if uh
if you got through that door there
there's protocols for them to run and report
so they might have already reported
and then we should move quick
uh
well
I'm trying to find this guy's name that we're trying to
flun
flun
flun um
I'm gonna ask him really quick about flun
ask if uh if they've seen him
uh yeah
these goblins would be like
oh yeah they
they interrogated that pretty boy
something nice I don't know if they ever got
what they were looking for
where did they get him
I don't
I haven't seen him since they brought him through here
like what it was that a day ago
two day and a half ago
I'm gonna repeat this as they're kind of telling me it
very quickly um
as I'm doing this
can you guys be prepared for us to kind of
make our way into this room
cause that's where we're gonna end up going
yeah I'm gonna ask the goblins
if they can give me a brief rundown
on the layout of the room
we're headed to yeah upstairs uh
he says uh
you're gonna go across the bridge
uh well it's
it's a it's a bridge on the map
uh it's a straight tunnel
uh
you go up the stairs you're a straight tunnel
it'll take you to a barracks
uh sometimes goblins are posted up in there
uh and then there's a
uh door that separates to the
um like
ranked members room
is kind of how you would describe it
and then
do these goblins have anything that's specific to them
specific to them like
do they have like
sashes that make them look like they're part of the uh
Zalantar's group or whatever
uh yeah
they probably have some you know
like 10 spoke wheel insignias on their armor
on their hide armor
um I'd like to see if I couldn't like
is there anything that I could snatch off of them
to kind of make me look more like them
I do have a disguise kit but it's
I'm more looking for something to be quick
maybe something I can hold or yeah
throw on uh
one of them would have a shield here in this room
that has the image of Xanathar on it
I'm gonna grab the shield
yeah and I'm just gonna
I'm gonna look back at Kate
um in the group and I'm gonna say
just follow me OK
uh what are we gonna do with these two though guys
well I was actually just thinking about that
uh Sudara
do you wanna wanna make him go uh
again
okay
yes let's knock them out
not might be fun not kill them unless we have to yeah
and then what do you need from me DM
a role or anything or just
no I mean they're
they're bound uh
just describe what your
how you uh
send these goblins to Dreamland
um I'd put an arm around uh
their neck little hammer bar
you know to cut off air supply
but you're just choking them out ha ha
I can't watch this oh shit man
the other cop is just watching his buddy get choked out
knowing he's next right
it would be as painless and quick as possible
yeah havoc recognizes the move and knows that it's a
that it's a pretty
that it's pretty gentle way to put them out
but he's still a little intimidated
that's good thing you did it
I was gonna kick one of their faces hahaha
alright I'm gonna do the Kung fu fighting later
I'm gonna go as quietly as possible
um
I'm gonna start crossing this this bridge
uh do I
as I'm going do I hear anything in the too far forward
yeah
no no
you don't hear anything uh
we're gonna pause pause here as you all uh
will progress forward uh
so the the party moves past
uh there's nothing of value of here
uh you
you enter into a sleeping area with six tattered straw
stuffed mattresses uh
in disarray
only a thin wooden door separates these rooms
and on the other side of that door
is a source of muffled voices
and the sounds of frantic activity
guys I'd like to ready in action
is this actually you're distracted already
is this actually a trap door
uh
no that's uh
a crate in the oh OK
duh
in the battle map
only the door to the south of the room is
direction that uh you would think this goes
uh I kind of look at havoc
and I point towards the sack in the corner
and then I mouth goodies to him
I don't say it out loud
I'll just mouth the word goodies
oh there we go oh
havoc was was drowning there alright
split it current forward
DM yes
Sudair is going to um
grab his short bow and knock an arrow sure
um ready and and attack action um if need be alright
anything that yeah
anything that comes through that door
you're trained upon at the moment
and Havoc's gonna have a shield
he's gonna wait guys
whenever whenever you guys are set and ready um
I'm gonna stumble through the door like
and you can see if I can't
at least have them focused on me but
but be ready be focused
we'll we'll have to play it by ear
once we see what's on the other side
are these manacles tied to this barrel
or are they free like no
they're like are they just like on the ground
yeah they're just like set on the table there
uh I would like to pick both of them up
and put them around my belt
how do I actually loot it
double clicking double clicking ah
and then you should be able to cool
are all are there ever going to
be any treasures that aren't like that
like is there a value to say I searched the straw beds
yes there will be
in this case right now no
okay okay alright
um
it's saying
GM Subax did not respond to the request
item piles require a GM to be connected interesting
uh it's
cause it's it's
they're going to
hey Kev
are you getting a pop up for that
no I've lost connection
oh
well that could be part of it
looks like I'm losing everybody
can you hear me still
yeah I can hear
you're a little you're a little robot
I'm not I'm
oh yeah you're cutting out now
yeah I'm not getting the
it might be on the um
the Foundry hosting too because I'm not seeing a pop up
you said it should should show something
I was yeah
as soon as you click it it'll pop up
it gives you the option to
to pick it up or split it or all of it
yeah okay
it looks like we're reconnecting to you though
so maybe you maybe try again
there is a uh
you'll need to Kevin
if it comes to you there's a
in the chat window you'll just need to accept
that's probably why they're coming to you
okay the last thing that
that came up was um
loot from the previous room with the gold pieces
I do not see new stuff coming
okay I got it
there we go alright
that came through and did it go to his inventory
yeah yes okay
alright guys alright good thanks
yeah that was just
it must have been a connection issue yeah
I think I was lagging I uh
when I came to discord
I could see that I had some red levels connectivity
looks like it settled out now
am I alright Music Bot also disconnected yeah
yeah Music Bot ended that uh
run we had we're actually at an hour already
I was quite impressed uh
but I can hit some other music here just a moment
cool
alright yeah
everything sounds good and the Foundry reconnected
no problem so hopefully everyone's good right now
awesome there we go yep
oh did not mean to do that
alright alright
so continuing on yeah
we're uh
you're in this room with six uh
threadbare sleeping cots in a thin wooden door
divides you from some frantic
conversation in the next room ever
so there's no benefit to me trying this door guys
and acting like you know
like being sneaky cause if I was supposed to be here
I wouldn't do that anyway
so I'm gonna kind of just push through the door
as hard as I well
first off can I kind of try the handle
is it locked uh no
yeah you
you can try the handle before you can uh
push through no
it doesn't appear to be locked
okay so I've got my shield uh
I've got my shield ready but I have a
I wanna make sure my crossbow is in my hand okay
um that is going to be my attack of choice
I'll make sure
alright are you like breach team moving through here
is this how this is gonna play out
just wanting to know the position of everybody is
see you guys push us through
I mean we should
we could stack
just out of sight to see what the initial response is
yeah I would say on this yeah
exactly on this wall yeah
I'll get it I'll get against this wall OK
yeah worst case scenario
I have Misty Step so if I need to
I'll pop back into the room and shut the door like
I look like a stacked up out of sight for the most part
direct line of sight it looks like
all right I am right all right
the door the door swings open
to reveal a scene of desperate chaos
a stout Graceskin Graceskin Dwergar
with a bald head and wiry black beard
is grunting with effort
trying to wedge a splintered table against the door
to the next room
working with him is a familiar wheezy human Krenze
the eyeball head tattooed man from the yawning portal
who quarreled with Yagra
his face is pale with sweat his eyes wide with terror
it's not working Zemp
I'm telling you grunts hisses his voice crackling
he gestures wildly at the shuddering door
they're barricating something came up from that pit
it got grab and neck just tore him apart
we have to block the bottom
that's how you stop a flow
the Dwergers zemp drives the shoves a table hard
his muscles bulging gutter crawling runts are weak
useless
grumshar left me in charge of this whole surface rat
not you he kicks a broken chair into the barricade
in the underdark we build with stone and timber
not your flimsy surface blankets
the furniture holds just as he says this
the door makes a behind the makeshift barricade
bulges inward with a wet percussive thump
the dark viscous
fluid begins seeping from a crack at the bottom
crunch shrieks gods you see it's coming
it's coming through
Dave see me
no they're not paying attention to you at all
I am going to ease back into the door and shut it yeah
um if I if I could do that
I'm gonna shut the door okay
uh
stop hold on
I have no idea what the hell is going on over there
but it sounds I'm gonna
I'm gonna relay what I've seen which is or heard
which is there's some kind of a pit
and something has come up
there's a dwemer uh
there's the human from the uh from the portal
um
they're frantic
and it looks like they're about to push through
do we pick this fight
what do we do
I didn't see I didn't see our guy I didn't see flun
right that's not the only yeah
no you didn't see anybody that looks like Flun
yeah the only people that might know where he is
are in that room and fighting for their life perhaps
we win the maid
we're gonna save those guys
oh man I get it
I get it I get it um
well let's push through them
uh alright
so stay here
I'm gonna suggest that you guys still stay here
I'm gonna see if I can at least get them on our side
first um
so I'm gonna open the door
I'm gonna come back through
I'm kind of looking exhausted
yeah as you come through here
you can see that they've both
both backed up from the door
the door is buckled under the immense pressure
on the other side uh
it like as you come through uh
the door busts and the furniture uh
that was bracing it also kind of like
crushes under the weight of this enormous
grey wall that has just completely filled
the door frame where this was
these guys are like back paddling to you havoc
they don't even they still don't even see you uh
it's like in this last moment where they like
turn around to flee this way
that they that they even see you at at this
I'm gonna I'm gonna take the shield
I'm gonna have my crossbow ready
uh
I'm going to say hurry quick quick
I've got your back run into the other room
there's nobody there you'll be safe and uh
just in a in an effort to get them to run past me
and hope that they run into those guys arms
to kind of catch them yeah
okay
and at the same time uh
I'm I'm gonna kind of side step
I'm gonna hold my shield out like I said
I'm gonna keep my crossbow ready not aimed at them
but yeah ready to shoot at them if they come at me
and I'm saying this in Goblin okay
uh yeah
they're they're like uh
holy shit like timing is great
get unload on this thing they're like
what are you waiting for and they run past you
sorry that that one went into the wall here
but yeah they uh
these two guys would be like bust into the room here
and immediately as they turn this corner they're
they're like
full sprint away from this creature that's come up
Kaylin Mora
they would get like right here before they'd stop uh
kind of like turn their backs to the wall and be like
hey what the what the fuck is going on here
how about it slam them up against the wall
strength check yes
strength check I'll strength check that too
hell yeah yeah
alright we're just gonna go strength for strength
ooh
alright
oh not great
where's my guidance I need to roll it
wow yeah
I'm gonna say it's how fast is this guy moving
it's slow like
uh he's
he's he's at a creeping pace um
so I noticed that I'm gonna totally raid this chest
yeah definitely
ha ha ha
Kailyn Mora I'm gonna say that uh
you don't like have a good grapple on them
but you're ready for them to come through uh
and as they do you both kind of uh
put the weight of your armored bodies into them
and check them into the wall you uh
you know square them up
neither of them are prepared here to uh
engage further but
I don't think that
you'd have a true understanding of what
is coming through the room next to you here
at this point havoc
you are eyeballing this large gray mass pushing out
yeah in this door frame
it's kind of like a jelly mold
pushing out from the door
like it's like uh
6 feet high rectangular
kind of keeping the shape of the
the door that it presses through
is this one of those are is this kind of like a
you know if you know kind of thing
yeah if you know
you know kind of thing yeah
what do you if you want a role specific for
do you truly know I'm
I'll let that go
yeah I'm just trying to think like
do I recognize do I
do I do I notice exactly what this is
is it the I personally
I'm not remembering the name of it right now
uh Cade would
Cade would push past Moira and uh
Kalin when they push them against the wall
and enter in the room with havoc
to back up his uh
his buddy yeah
uh I would yell at the dwarger uh
when I pinned him yeah
tell us where Flun is
uh he's
he's like ah
that boy's ready to be killed off here
he's like he's in the main hall
uh boss had his way with him
hey guys not to uh
not to say the flu is not that important
but I do seem to have some form of a blob of
of unusual size coming through the door here
um just to kind of make everybody aware
um
what's the I think best situation here during that
to roll for initiative unless there's
I'll give you all one
1 last action here and then we'll roll for initiative
cause the slime is creeping now yeah
would would there be a skill
would there be a skill check to determine what
this wall is
what which wall sorry
uh the sorry
not the wall the
the this thing
uh yeah
you do a nature check for me oh
I know I would yell at the dwargan
I would yell at the dwargan and under comment yeah
we either fight together or we die together
and I don't wanna die next to you yeah
uh OK
I I don't think that you would know
specifically like what type of ooze it is
but I mean OK
you've heard you've heard of this type of creature
uh I
you know I do have um cybooster knack
which if I fail an ability check using a skill or tool
which I am uh which I'm proficient with
I'm not proficient with nature
never mind okay
hey uh
well Mora
I think that the uh dwarf would be like
listen then you know
your weapons are useless and he's like quick
let's bust up one of these tables and he uh
points to the table that the manacle
manacles were on and uh he's like some clubs quickly
hi no metal against this thing
only wood and magic yeah
alright let's uh
everybody will roll for initiative here
uh the tentative alliance between the Dwergar
and the human
alright so alright
oh no
I'm too close to go so so late
nice some good rolls coming in here
nice alright
I think that's everybody
alright
in order then
Mora your turn to act
alright um
I I assume I've acquired a wooden club then yeah
I'll I'll say that
you and the dwergar had a moment to bash that table
uh there's four clubs that have gone around you
and he both have one
okay uh
how are we dealing with rolling that and all that fun
jazz I'm gonna give you a club right now
perfect news alright
then I'm gonna take said club and run
into the room here to actually see what we got going on
okay uh
I will explain by Morton's beard
look at that thing I haven't seen one that big
since I cleaned the toilets at the forge found
or was it the uh
a Forge Fortress yeah
Forge Fortress Forge Fortress

I still got a couple feet of movement
we're gonna get to this side

it does roll excellent news and then back to targeting
and oh yeah we're gonna go clubbing with Morgan

what was your damage on the spiritual weapon roll
though it was definitely a hit
but I didn't see the damage roll
I died

oh here it is right
yeah there it is
let's see attack now I don't need attack
I need damage yeah

alright yeah
what's your spiritual weapon
it's like this hammer of Morden
it's a Morden's ball pin hammer
and it ding like a tin hammer nice
every time it hits it even though it's obviously an use
and thematically I'll just bring the shield back up
and get back into combat position OK
that will be my turn Awesome
Sudara it is your turn to act

is the human crence from the yawning portal
he's gonna pick up one of the clubs as well
he's gonna push forward past you guys uh
he's not actually gonna go into attack range though uh
he does have a crossbow
and he will go crossbow at it though
and he misses
alright and then we're on to Cade your turn
do you on mute I'm not sure uh let me check
Kade are you muted
yes you're muted if you're done
oh I'm muted sorry
yeah sorry
I was gonna I move 10 feet to make some space um
and then I was gonna throw one of my psychic blades
at it okay
but I think that's a miss
no Ten's actually hit
let me just oh really
yep oh huge
all right it ain't got nothing
and then damage
for that 1
7
and then I will VEX him with my weapon
mastery for daggers
OK uh
and then
do a bonus action attack with my other psychic blade OK
oh I should have rolled that with advantage
let me roll it one more time
that's a hit anyway just yeah
just to see if I crit oh yeah
good call
I do not crit but it's still a hit alright
uh damage
6 and then sneak attack for advantage okay
for an extra 5 damage nice
so 11+ uh
whatever yeah
this thing is a like amorphous shape
just pushing out your strikes at it
don't really do any specific color or like
change damage to it but uh
you strike through yeah yeah
the the attacks wouldn't even be visible anyway
with these psychic blades yeah
so I'm just kind of hoping that I'm doing something
all right um
but yeah that'll be my turn Sir Kellen your turn to act
alright um
this is where our dude is not an ally right
no he is not okay um
do I have to use have my movement to push through him
or an extra 10 feet to move
what
is it considered difficult terrain to go through him
no you can push past him
alright so I'll go ahead and push past him
um that's 10 um
that's 20 and then let's see 30 um
can't do anything
as far as
uh
I also can't push this creature
I'm assuming he's too big
um I'll dash to get up there with Moira
um and then that's gonna be my turn for now okay
yeah cause I'm kind of far back there
um so action dash then that's it
okay
it is the dwarves turn to uh attack
he's going to move 5 10 15
20 25
30 he just rushes forward with his club out as well
oh
and gets absorbed yeah
his club is just like
immediately sucked into this creature
alright that's his turn
uh then we are on to havoc
um havoc is going to
so if I use true strike with my short bow
or with my crossbow um
I can that create that makes it a radiant
that makes it radiant damage right
true strike so I think that that should be what it yeah
whether you deal radiant damage
or the weapon's normal damage
the attack deals extra radiant damage
when you reach level 5 okay
yeah so you
you can choose to deal radiant damage
okay that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
that
yeah it's definitely a hit
and then damage is different because it's true strike
right I think I do this man
wait we just use your spell casting ability
rather than your dexterity for a ranged weapon
so I think your spell casting is
one more than your dexterity if I recall correctly
sorry I'm still trying to figure out where I roll that
uh you can click into
you can roll a d 20+ four
12 is a hit
so then it would bro is 20
is that the damage sorry
uh I realized you're on damage now uh
let's see your
it would be your crossbow still damage
but you would add
4 instead of 3 so it's a um
what's your normal damage is
sorry I clicked that not you
uh damage would be 1 d 8 + 4 instead of 3
so you do 1 d 8+ four
it's it's rolling my
it won't let me roll my oh
that's cause I'm clicking the button
I'm a dumbass I
I also clicked it on there for you as well
so okay probably uh such in the wrong spot
but yeah uh
so there we go 10 okay
but it it calculated plus 3
so it's it would really be 11 on your damage okay
I'll take that okay
and then um
for a bonus action
no actually I'm good
I'll leave that okay
then it's the huge gray oozes turn
uh he is a morphus and uh
has some abilities to multi attack
uh he is going to multi attack
and he is going to multi attack uh Mora
as the closest one to him
and he does so with his suit of pod
uh 24
mmm hmm yep
please stay okay
21 damage
haha alright
that's a lot of damage
I uh I have noticeably knocked back and
immediately without breath
alright
and then uh multi attack if he uh knocks you back
I'll let you stumble backwards
uh second attack will go on Kalin
yeah
alright it's more dramatic
but come on let me move
it's not your turn
so it's it's gonna rely on me to move you
alright Sir Kailyn never mind
uh I got a 20 on my roll on you
yeah that hits okay
and we're gonna roll some damage here
whoa got a lot of sixes there
15
holy shit
oh sorry
how did I uh
oh I see it's uh
it got resistances so when I had a target it's uh
it actually came out to 30
yep okay
alright and
it's a
still trying to push through this doorway with you
the dwergar uh Kaylin Amora you standing there
it does not push any further forward
uh
your armor does take a affliction of the corrode metal
if you do get hit 5 times
your uh armor will be destroyed
as of right now it has awesome
it has no immediate effect on your armor class
if you get hit again
each of you will get a negative 1 to your armor class
from your armor
okay
and with that we are at the top of the order again more
I'm gonna stumble you back one space
with damage rolls like that
I don't know if anybody could even survive
getting hit five times
no if I get hit like that again I'm dead
yeah she she clear clear dead
uh
it's been damaged that's not enough uh
by Morden's beard
this creature will not take us all
Sir Cailen save us friend
and then I am going to charge forward
with reckless abandon
near ignorance and we be clubbing nice 16 is a hit
nice Max rolls max damage once more
and because Spiritual Weapon is up
guess who's getting smacked again
just check your target
looks like you're on Kalin at the moment
oh sorry
that's okay why
that's kind of fault um
it is not letting me off it
because I don't have the slots
um
let's see
you can't maintain yeah
yeah yeah
actually no
I would have had to drop that for shield of faith so
uh that will end my turn never mind
alright then Cigarro
your turn to act
alright we're gonna rinse and repeat with another um
what should we call it
another short pal
yeah
does an 8 hit uh an 8 is a miss
well that's just rude
um dice wise
I mean um
yeah that'll be the end of my turn okay
I realized I uh
never rolled reneer into combat
let me see where he comes in just to see
I would have been towards the top here
uh he does have a crossbow
if you want I can move him forward
he would probably take a shot with his crossbow
yeah yeah
I'm good with that extra damage is always accepted
plus 4
yeah he misses though
and then we're on to Crence's turn
he is also gonna take a shot with his light crossbow
again 17 is a hit he deals damage
nice you're smacking this guy yeah
not there's really no way to see he did
he's not showing damage right
no he literally just looks like a gray wall
pressing through this door here
alright Kate
it is your turn to act now
are you muted again are you on mute
I gotta stop I gotta stop doing that
I'm trying to not be like
distracting during like other people's turns
okay um
before I actually attack I would like to say something
uh kind of to the group um
as I'm readying my my blades to throw again um
I'll say uh
if this thing doesn't seem like it's taking any damage
um soon we should we should get ready to run
um and then I'll throw my blades
okay
23 should hit that's a hit
yep
okay and then damage
6+ sneak attack
for another 6 12 and then my bonus action attack
16 nice
uh and then damage on this one
for another 6 so total of 18 damage
yep uh and then uh
that is my turn I'll kind of stay where I am okay
yeah this thing is still just kind of
pushing slowly through the doorway
uh Kalin
it was uh focused on you
and it just kind of like continues to press forward
right in your face it's your turn to act
alright um bonus action uh thunder smite
okay
um so there's that consumes spell slot
I'm not concentrating on heroism
heroism should have been gone
yeah a while back
um I don't have a club
can you place one in my inventory please
yes you can have the last club
and that will claim everybody's clubs
alright you should have a club now
okay thank you
um target creature gonna go ahead and uh hit if I can
uh normal
definitely a hit outstanding
uh go ahead and do the damage
and then the smite is gonna be here
uh public role
it's a 10 thunder damage okay
so it was 10 damage from the club
and then 10 thunder damage on top of that
correct okay
just making sure I got that right
and that should knock
this creature 10 feet away from me
it needs to succeed on a DC14 strength saving throw
okay
alright it uh fails on its saving throw
yeah this uh creature
although uh
seemed to have some form of like gelatinous shape
as it's pressing through the door
Caitlin you uh
ramp up with your club and drop a uh
thunderous smite with the
favor of your god on this thing
and it kind of like pops it like a balloon
it just kind of is like a
a uncooked jelly
and it kind of like splatters backwards
uh the floor just kind of stretches out
it looks like a a wet puddle
and if it weren't for the two goblin bone
like sets of goblin bones that are in this
inside of this creature uh
you would just think this is a a wet room
a wet slicked room
okay um
and I am personally going to take a couple steps back
using some of my movement here and uh end up here
and that will be my turn thank you
alright
uh I think that this dwergar would attempt to
I I don't think he would go into the room
with this thing
but I think he would step forward here and
and ready and attack
with his club
so we'll wait on him for what his action is havoc
your turn to act
are you muted
yes sorry
is uh so is this thing just retreating or is it dead
no it got uh thunder smited backwards into the lavatory
okay um
how it's gonna go forward just to get line of sight
okay
yeah um
I am going to first off
wait just sorry
yeah first I'd like to use my innate sorcery
it gives uh
my spell save DC of my sorcerer spells goes up by 1
but more importantly
it gives me advantage on attack rolls
for sorcerer spells
um I can use it twice before long rest so I'm gonna
I'm gonna use that
which is a bonus action and then I'm going to cast
uh
chaos ball okay
and I get to do it at an advantage
oh crap nice
oh
and I trigger does that trigger my chaos thing though
yeah that does alright
let's take a look what's your uh
you have do you have your chaos magic list
oh yeah
oh hold on
so it's in this one folder
oh wait you sent me you sent me a preferred one
well I had a we
we talked about one uh
I don't think we ever actually settled on one
but let me go back in our conversation too here I can
this is what I had I'll post it in discord
but I think that this is the new 2024
it's in uh
I'll put in game logo that's fine
yeah I'm fine with this
roll on this yeah
will this work
yeah you wanna roll a
I'm fine so do I do yeah
I don't
I don't necessarily understand the mechanics of this
yet yeah
um but you've
does it do the chaos bolt first
and then it cast a different spell or yeah
they kind of work simultaneously
so you chaos bolt and then
it basically triggers this wild magic effect
that happens simultaneous to your chaos bolt
all right D1 hundred going okay
1717
you are subjected to an effect
that lasts for one minute
unless the description says otherwise
godly it would be the longest one
yeah bro 1 v eight
alright let's start there
sorry guys I don't know
this is the fun part
finally getting finally getting your chaotic magic
alright four
you must shout when you speak
not as bad as it could be boys wait
how long does this last for
for the rest of your life
it lasts for 1 minute unless it says otherwise
so you gotta shout for 1 minute
alright uh
please don't shout in discord
can we just roll that as character
yeah yeah yeah
please
I don't have anything to say uh
I just need to roll damage now right
yeah roll damage for your chaos bolt critical
and it's critical damage
that means you're shouting
all of your verbal components
nice for your spells
or just shouting your spells like an anime
chaos bolt chaos bolt chaos bolt
uh alright yeah
I need to do this and uh yeah
it's a 19 and I believe is that all my movement
um no it looks like habit is going three
you can move three more spaces
havoc is gonna step to the left here okay
um I'm keeping an eye both on the bandit here
and the dwemer yeah
just just to you know
just to be aware of all the dangers in the room
sure
and then my turn is over which I can now go to here
thank you alright
this gray is kind of starts to reform its shape a bit
and it starts pressing forward again
gets within range of the Dwergar
it's enough that he makes a pseudopod attack
and then he makes the second
oh what is that
that cocked on the 14 but it looked like a 20
uh that is definitely a hit on the dwergar
and he rolls for damage
poof
26 yeah uh
the no shit twerker is uh
kind of like caught up in the
stretching tendrils of this ooze
and it's kind of like the
the blunt of the hit knocks the wind out of him
and he uh is bent forward
and the ooze just kind of like envelops his body
and it the hit and the follow up action are
enough that the dwarf just kind of kills over
into the mass of this ooze
the human uh crence is like God
God's no
what are we gonna do with this thing
Mora
back up to you at the top of the order
oh you're muted as well
thank you um
Morris seeing the dwarger uh
swallowed whole
will stage left to the far wall as far as possible
and declare I just believe we should leave
and
then it will be
all the dead on
the injured we hope we yeah
well actually it matters is the creature wounded or not
yes for the spell the creature it is wounded OK
yes excellent news
so please enjoy your saving throw of pain
nineteen
no oh
it's to 17 sorry 17
well uh
it still does no pain or no damage
yeah I think it does
hold on no
if it's a can trip it does no damage on a success
no damage neighbors suck
alright no
no damage say your second
so yep okay
that will be his uh turn okay
it is Reneer's turn to act
he is going to crossbow again
that is a hit
uh reneer deals 9 damage to the creature
his uh
like crossbow bolt just pierces the outer form
and you just kind of see the
the bolt sticking inside of this
sudor it's your turn to ask the Druid warrior
is he dead dead or just down to 0 hit points
uh he is enveloped inside of this ooze at the moment uh
you would think that he is
he he looks deceased best you can tell
alright forgive him then huh
sorry about the dude but
yep nineteen's a hit
25 sorry
yeah you uh line up your short bow uh
you all have been peppering this thing for
the better part of a couple moments here and uh
feels like the you haven't made any progress at all
and suddenly sudara
your arrow seems to find the right spot
this creature uh
like pops like a balloon the
the morphing shape of it and the liquidity uh
kind of like scatters and begins to just spread like a
like a wet oil over all of the
surface of the floor in this room
and the room next to it
and the creature no longer seems to be moving
is the jaguar still enveloped in the thing or no
yeah it it like kind of like washes away from him
but he is not moving uh
even like there's layers of him that look like uh
have already been like part of his beard is missing
some of his ear is missing
are we out of initiative yeah
we're out of initiative now let me in so
I can use my healer's kit if he's at 0 hit points
if he's dead dead then there's nothing I can do
let me do saving throws for a turn here
are you spare the dying on him as well
more are you muted
I will eventually stop doing that to myself
I was chewing yes I am sparing the dying on him okay
yes
I will say that if you're committing to spare the dying
that he was not killed
but he was in his death saving throws uh
it was not a long enough time that uh he is deceased
so
spare the dying will bring him back to a stable state
having to make sure that the other bandit uh
isn't looking around too much
um hey you what what the hell is that
what are you guys messing with down here
he's he's like that's that's not one of ours
you think we're like ooze ranchers or something
haha
you said one of ours
assuming maybe you're not ooze ranchers
but you knew what this creature was
oh yeah you spend enough time in the sewers
you'll find a a gray ooze lurking down here
these things suck
they uh take like a whole armory out if you don't
if you aren't careful
tarnish your weapons immediately
hmm what would happen if uh if say a group of 1
2 3
4
5 of us held say
someone of your size up against one
until they told us where our friend was
what do you think would happen then
he's like oh
probably wouldn't do too much for that one
you just popped it like a like a bowl of water
well
that's a good point well if we find another one
what would happen hypothetically
yeah uh
you guys make a persuasion
or make a intimidation check with your like
let me find another one like another great
can I give him advantage on that please
yeah please
OK awesome
you have advantage no
oh not 20
oh nice
yeah he's like
he's like whoa
I was just joking about the
the slime rancher bit
you guys aren't you guys aren't slime ranchers
are you like
you wouldn't actually put me in one of those
would you as you can tell
he's like that depends
do you know
do you know where an individual named flun is
oh yeah
they've been interrogating flun in the uh
main hall here for like the last day
captured him from some bar outside a
outside the dock board
everyone keeps on telling us last day
but what about today
uh he's like
well if this fucking ooze didn't show up uh
bosses wanted us to kill him
so it looks like it's Flun's lucky day
if you're here to rescue him
and it'll be your lucky day if you show us where he is
he's like oh OK
you gonna let me go if I just show you where he is
if you take us to him
and promise us safe passage out of the sewers
related to your group
okay he's like
uh I think that can be negotiated
well we're burning sewer light so let's
like kind of gesture for him to like get going
yeah uh
he takes you through this uh door here
and down the hall extends
kind of similar to the stone
halls that you've already been going through
but there's a staircase at the end of this hall
that you would be progressing up
he says yeah
last I last I knew grumshar had him up here
and he steps up under this
I think somebody's on top of my token
I can't move him
no worries we'll get you there you go
you don't like to be on the bottom
that's rule No. 28 yeah
never be a bottom
I'm gonna use 14 points of lay on hands on myself okay
uh would you mind adding that to my hip point pool
I can't change it I will for you
uh let's
thank you see
got you here
should be back to 22 if my math is right correct
thank you OK
all right
let me go to my notes here
uh all right
beyond the hallway
up the staircase lies a larger ceremonial hall
the air here is shockingly cool and still
the silence profound
after the chaos from the previous room
the human stench of the sewer is gone
replaced by a faint lingering scent of something alien
like burnt lavender
the threadbare curtains perhaps once opulent
hang in tatters on the east wall in the center room
slumped against the base of a raised stone pillar uh
platform is a man
his expensive looking clothes are ripped and stained
and his wavy
red blond hair is matted with sweat and grime
but this is uh oh
it's flun but this is not the charming
vibrant man you heard about
he is eerily still his eyes are open
but they are utterly vacant
staring through you at a horror only he can see
a thin line of drool trickles
from one corner of his open mouth
he doesn't react to your immediate presence
doesn't even seem to register that he's no longer alone
he looks like a discarded marionette with cut strings
a handsome vessel
from which the spirit has been violently scooped out
the architects of this misery appear to be gone
this is a broken man and all that's left is their work
as you approach Flun's vacant
uh as you approach Flun's vacant eyes slowly
almost painfully begin to focus on you
there's a slight tremor in his hands
and he begins to speak with a dry
raspy whisper
a stark contrast to the boisterous man Volo described
yeah uh
flun uh
reneer would definitely rush past you as well
but uh
does anybody else approach at the same time
yeah Caitlin will approach cautiously
noting the state of the man
and try to suss out what exactly happened to him
yeah if he's stable
then there's nothing that I'll do except um
overwatch again um
Shortbow action ready
yeah he uh
doesn't seem like there's anybody else
present in this space the human bandit
Crence
has
basically revealed that they were supposed to kill him
but that the grey ooze coming up from their hideout uh
essentially thwarted their plans to get it done and uh
you busted in at just about the right time
uh
reneer pushes past uh
his usual aristocratic composure shattered
he drops to his knees beside his friend
his hands hovering almost afraid to touch him
and he's like Flun
by the gods Flun
are you alright I thought I feared the worst
he gently places a hand on Flun's shoulder
and at the touch flun flinches
but he slowly turns his head
and there's a spark of recognition
some like faint let uh
spark in his eyes of
you know friends are near here once again
uh Kevin
you wanted to uh
do an insight check on uh
just if you can understand like
what might have caused his current state
or what they've currently done to him
yeah if there's some kind of medicine check
or something I can do to uh
see if uh
it's some kind of magic thing in nature
or it's just the traumatic nature of torture itself
yeah what
whatever happened whatever check you want me to run
yeah do a medicine check for me
okay
yeah not great
yeah you
I mean you've seen the effects of combat on people
and the stresses that are placed on people's bodies
you know you kind of assessing him while
flu and reneer having a little bit of a reunion
he's got some very
like heavy burn marks on his body
that almost are in the shape of handprints
it looks like maybe maybe he was being like
burned or tortured with like burns
but outside of that
nothing that seems too unusual to a visual inspection
medical inspection
does anything look like arcane based
like magic based like his condition
would it be something that like
that seems to be giving off any like magical
I don't know
residue or something no
I don't think that uh
I think that there's a particular like magical residue
uh that you're able to perceive
without any particular spells
it's not like he's you know
radiating light or other yeah
I guess more is this like a condition that I may have
that I may know of that is magically induced
I think the most comparable state would be like
your nitrous gas
uh OK
like a nitrous gas overdose
you've probably seen people in this type of like
you know dazed stupor
uh
wouldn't wouldn't cause the
the burn marks uh
but yeah I mean that yeah
that would probably be like your most comparable
okay feedback
yeah I would say let's
let's get him out of here
is there anything else of note in this uh
this compound that we should briefly look at any
I I don't think I see anything else here
no just some doors
yeah there's there's a
a couple rooms here at the
um
the room to your left here
if you uh
take a moment to explore
you would find your way up to the sniper perch for uh
the goblins on this side but they
they seem to have left their post and are uh
nowhere to be found here uh
on this side
it does appear to be only flun present in this
segment of the chamber
okay see
and stable enough to move
yeah he
he's uh
definitely injured but stable enough to uh
get up and move uh
it was like if he leans on reneer and
and you know
okay then we need to go guys yeah
I for one
have no desire to be in the sewer
any longer than we need to
yeah I agree yes
let's get moving yeah
uh I would say flutes probably like ah
you came for me truly by the gods
I thought it was I thought that was the end
trapped in the dark with the whispers
thoughts that felt like my save it twisted
save all that until we get topside
let's go okay
yeah you guys uh
push your way out uh
what do you do with the human
crence that you're leaving behind
once I I mean
once we once he leads us back to the surface I'd
I'd you know let him go
um
alright uh
do you press him for the way out or do you
just let him lead you on the way out that you suspect
I no
I I assume that my
that my intimidation yeah
kind of would make him fall
like tell the truth and not lie
alright so
so he he tells you that there is two ways out
there is a back way through a family's basement
essentially but they don't know that they have access
uh
the other way is through the basement of a storefront
called Red Brindle Saddle Saddlery
um
but he he would be able to tell you either way
so basically
I have a back exit through a hidden family residence
or the
like
the closest way down here would take you up through a
business cellar
how long would it take for us to backtrack
to where we initially entered
um probably not nearly as long as it is
no we can't
we can't jump
we can't jump those gaps with flun like this okay
never mind
whatever the whatever the quickest way is
if we go through the house
I'd rather not go through the house
we'll give them a couple of gold pieces
they'll be fine or the business
whatever the easiest and fastest way
yeah OK
I recommend that we
either
send somebody back down here to get these goblins
that we tied up or
that'll be fun
alright I like it I'm in
I don't like them anyway stupid cousin fine
alright I think that uh uh
crence would be like alright
this is this is the easiest way out here
he'd push through uh
in this room here in this front room
he'd push through a
like unlatched wooden panel and you'd find yourself in
the cool earthy basement
where there's obviously like some
fermenting grains and hops in
uh like this uh meticulously kept cellar
there's uh you know some uh beer brewing
uh and then uh you uh
can realize that there's a
like a stone panel that you can slide
and it takes you into a tunnel
and it
you're like ducking under the edge of this house
and you're out on the street in water deep once again
uh with just a little bit of effort uh
flun and reneer uh following closely behind you
uh
you as you uh ascend back to the um
uh streets of water deep
the oppressive gloom of the sewers
the stench of stagnant water and decay
is clinging to your clothes
but uh
you're suddenly assaulted with the water deep sunlight
and the city bustle isn't its usual
the air is uh now carrying this
sweet and hearty scent of roasted nuts
spiced wine and blooming spring flowers
uh you've surfaced directly into the saloon sashelas
which is the land based parade of fleets wake
just as it's begun its grand possession from the docks
uh you know
all of the streets here are kind of um
expanding with uh uh revelers
children with their faces painted this whole week
uh the week of Fleet's wake
is kind of a week long Celebration
as mentioned of the
uh dock workers
uh or like the
the boats being able to break through the uh
ice barriers and the spring coming and the uh
the winter ice uh
breaking away so that the docks uh
ships in the uh
harbor can uh
return to their work out in the ocean
um
I think that uh
as you kind of push your way
uh reneer is like
let's go back to my estate
we'll get cleaned up and I
I will summon Volo to settle all of this matter
uh and uh
he uh
grabs a nearby nearby yeah
he grabs a nearby merchant or urchin
I don't actually know where
never went never remember
let me find that
I'm sure it's on the map
it should be like the North Ward
I'm I'm sure it is North Ward
North Ward or Castle Ward one of those
Mendever Street and Wim Street
between the North Ward and the Sea Ward
Wim street is here
right here solmer
uh
East West Street solmer
you said I think this might be it brander tall
yeah here you go
Brenda tall this is it
let me go
show two players
there you go
I don't know can I jump to it on the map
jumped the pin
uh yeah
so let me go back to my notes here
uh so as you cross the city uh
you would see
uh you know
quite a few number of things
the the Sea Maidens fair uh
is likely uh
one of the leaders of this parade
there's all sorts of exotic animals
they're like an owl bear in a cage on a
a float parade uh
they are jugglers stilt walkers
uh they're handing out advertising bills for a carnival
on the Pier of wonders in the dock ward
uh
you can see uh
the there's a uh
like very fantastically dressed uh captain
uh like very
uh large red hat
red plumed feathers uh
like large flowing red cape
he's kind of like pointing around at the crowd with his
uh uh
like big steel rapier uh
but you can see there's all sorts of uh
like fantastic creations in this parade
as it presses by and you're waiting to uh
progress to Reneer's uh estate
uh there's uh
a parade segment uh
with members of the house of Gond
and the house of wonders
and they have huge clockwork automata that are
like floating down the street
there's a beholder
automaton beholder that's hovering
it's like different eye beams are just kind of like
shooting out different rays of light into the crowd
but uh it's
purely a mechanical being
uh with no
uh specific biological parts
uh you know
they have different uh types of automata
uh representing all sorts of different animals
but uh
there's like a group of uh
them carrying some of the prominent members of the uh
house of god and the
house of wonders and you can see as the
as they're walking by like
some of the mechanical creatures
are doing some pretty impressive acrobatics
that
surpass even the quality of the best
acrobats that you've seen in the parade
but it's a it's a struggle
you find yourselves
eventually pushing past the laughing revelers
and ducking under streamers
and weaving through the impromptu dance circles
and you eventually make your way to the north ward uh
where things are a bit quieter
but still there's some festive banners
and you reach the three story villa of the
never remembers
uh the elegant stone facade
stark contrast to the riot of color
you've just escaped
and uh
almost before reneer can knock
a a curt and impeccably dressed butler
his face usually masked with stoic professionalism
visibly sags with relief upon seeing reneer
and the bedraggled fruit flun
and without a word he ushers you all inside
uh with some looks of profound gratitude
and we move to
oh let me
I should have focused it here
but we're all on this floor
and the door opens here and Flun and reneer move in
oh and they go into
the parlor here there's a
like a flurry of the the butlers here on uh
Flun's property they uh
begin like supplying you with
you know dry towels and
you know washcloths and offering to take anything
that seems to be uh overly mucked up
uh you know
like
more servant folk than probably any of you have seen
in one location uh
just kind of all appear from all corners of this uh
estate uh
like whirling around you uh
offering you these concessions
Havok is gonna like
continuously take rags when he's offered them
and just tuck them in the little pockets in his
in his cloak as he walks by
and just kind of looking suspiciously at everything
I will engage in the services for cleaning his armor
and himself
I think Kate would grab one 1
like wet cloth and like a cold
like basin of water and just kind of like begin
like dabbing it on his uh
on his forehead and putting it around his neck
to cool himself
yeah uh
you guys are in here for a moment
the interior is a world away from the sewers
dank confines
that you've just been mucking around in for some time
uh the parade's boisterous crush as well
uh polished mahogany panels line the walls
gleaming warmly in the filtered light
rich velvet cushions adorn the plush furniture
there's a pleasant warmth radiating from a grand
marble faced fireplace uh
and like I said the
the the servants just kind of appear
and disappear in a whirlwind with uh
warm water towels
all the things that you need
reneer still trembling slightly
immediately moves to a side table
he begins pouring everyone
a generous glass of red wine from a crystal decanter
uh he hands them out
his head's steady despite his visible emotion
I I don't have any words
Renier says
you saved me from those gutter dwelling thugs
and then you went back into that hell
to find my friend
Waterdeep needs more friends like your uh
more souls like yours truly
thank you and he
uh after giving everybody a glass
he raises a toast to all of you
I'll return this toast
he kind of half heartedly raises his glass for a toast
really kind of just like keeping it up by his like
like eye level not raising it above his
his head but kind of like holding it out by his
by his eyes yeah
so Caitlin will return the toast and he'll say
we survived that's worth the prayer alone
um let's greet the sunrise
with still hearts and steady blades as always
yeah I think uh
reneer is uh
I don't think that he would in a bath
worship morning wouldn't hurt
yeah that he's like plenty of
plenty of space for uh
for cleaning up here but uh
let's uh
let's pause here for a short break
and then we'll pick up with uh
the original quest giver here for uh
so we're at 17 after
let's say we'll come back at 27 after and we'll resume
sound good 10
10 minutes here for everybody
nope good to go
I'll have I'll have
to bow out at 9 um
I got a really early morning tomorrow
we're rock we're rocking 12 miles at like 3:00am
so how bad
yeah
okay
can't wait to get that DD 2:14
I cannot wait is that 9:00
is that in 45 minutes for you
uh yeah
it's 8 it's 8:16 or 8:18 right now
so I have to be another time I have to cut out as well
that'll be 10:00 my time but I gotta go and get my son
okay so that'd be fine
yep fine see you guys in ten
alright we're at 26 after
just let me know when you return here if you would
please I'm here
cool
here uh
could you swap my my token on the map
it seems you probably had this one before the yeah yep
got you dope I'm back
sweet
I think that's everybody
yep cool
yep
alright uh
yeah so you're standing in the parlor here with uh
flun and reneer
uh kind of commiserating about your uh
time in the sewer here
anybody
anything in particular to say to flun or reneer
at the moment yeah
I think as I
as K kind of grabs his like cloth and starts
you know cooling himself off
uh he kind of look to flun and be like
so uh
what did you do to piss off the uh
Xenitharion so much
yeah uh
I think you got two guilds confused
there's the Zentarum and then there's
the Zana Zana
Zana
Zana Tar okay
was the was the gang that yes
he that took it
yeah the Zana Tar
yeah yep
uh zenithar uh
he he says
uh oh
they kept asking about reneer
about his father
I don't think I told him anything of importance
it was all a blur of fear
there were goblins and a
oh man there was this floating
monster with purple skin and tentacles
around his mouth
that felt like he was peeling my thoughts like a grape
would that description bring anything to mind
I I would like to roll a uncommon history check on that
yeah for sure
I'll let you do that uncommon history with advantage
cause that's most likely where you would encounter them
um kid
I'll let you do a same if you wanna roll for a check
um if it's under common
I probably wouldn't okay
yeah I'll do it anyway
not with advantage
cause I definitely don't know on like the under yeah
yeah
uh alright
uh more definitely
you would have an understanding immediately
when he speaks of a intellect devour uh
a being of
uh
immense mental capabilities
controlling thoughts controlling emotion
forcing people to do things against their will
uh
definitely a master interrogator
uh the layers of concern immediately
uh flood your head with like Flun's well being like
is he truly as uh
all right as he says he is
uh these creatures are known to uh
decimate people's minds and leave them just a Hulk
uh prison
their own brains trapped in a body
um but
uh assessment of fluent that you speak on it yeah
would the fact that you speak on it would
tell me that you survive
this much more impact but I worry for you
those creatures are very dangerous
they're they're mental
assaults or things of legend in an uncommon
what did he say that they were asking him about
Reneer's father
Lord never Ember yeah Lord never Ember
um okay
yeah I don't
I don't think that
Sudara would know anything about that
so I'm gonna be quiet yeah
I would uh
then I would kind of look to reneer after hearing that
and be like
is his father pretty famous in Water Deep
yeah yeah
all right okay
uh you would
you would all know for a fact uh
Lord Neverember
was the previous open Lord of Water Deep
uh I'll get into a little bit of uh
like game lore here the
council of Water Deep is a group of masked lords
with a singular open lord
at any given time the open lord
represents kind of like the face of the city
the masked lords are typically other nobles or
other appointed officials that are
their identities are kept hidden
so that there can be no reprisal of
you know
their judgments against whatever actions the city takes
so
the city essentially
conceals the identity of some of its
government officials
Lord Neverember was the open Lord
and was found to be embezzling money from the city
in an attempt to rebuild the city of never winter
uh he has now fled the city of water deep
and has since been living in Neverwinter
presumably with some of the money that he embezzled
but there is a known rumor
that a large portion of the money
is hidden somewhere within water deep
you could not have moved
the amount of money that they claim was
stolen
without somebody giving him up
at this point so
there's no way that they
believe that the money could have been moved
out of the city at this point
and there's a suspicion that reneer
has some knowledge of that
but reneer
does not seem to have any general knowledge of that
well uh
reneer it might be a good idea to uh
double your security and uh maybe
refrain from going out on the town at night without
maybe some armed escort it's likely that
this won't be the last time that
the Xanathar syndicate would uh
try to
try to take you
yeah he's
he's like thankful for the words of advice
he's you know
certainly concerned for him and his friend's safety
uh
he's you know
interested in all the work that you've done for him
and he's uh
you know about to kind of go into something but uh
the uh
doors to the parlor burst open
uh and in strides Volo
and he's like aha
uh he's
he's looking a little flustered
his magnificent hat is slightly askew
he's clutching a scroll tube into
to his chest like it's a lifeline
uh and he's like
ah there you are
there you are wonderful magnificent
uh flun flun
my boy flun barely acknowledges
uh Volo's entrance
uh Renier
my boy thank you for hosting and
and you he says
turning to the party with a grand sweeping gesture
my saviors my heroes
ready for the reward I promised
I trust payment for a job brilliantly done
and he pauses
and for the first time
you see the master orator falter
and he like bows his head for a moment
and he kind of puts his hands to his mouth
and he thinks
and he said um
about that yes
a temporary complication you see my latest manuscript
a thrilling expose on the gelatinous cube mating habits
has my royalties rather tied up at the moment
uh a question of international shipping manifests
and impatient publishers in Baldur's gate
a clerical nightmare
and he kind of waves his hands dismissively
uh his face is a bit red with embarrassment
uh he says
I confess
that I have but a few dragons to my name
at this very moment
but never let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise
and with his uh
return to his usual bombast
he kind of like flourishly presents the
a scroll tube and he says
I offer you not coin which is spent and forgotten
but a foundation a home
an investment in your own burgeoning legend
and he uncaps the scroll tube
and he unfurls the scroll
and lays it out on the table here in the parlor
it's filled with some spidery script bearing uh
some official wax seals he says
this is the deed to Trollskold Manor
a historic property
right here in the prestigious North Ward
I purchased it myself
it's rumored to be magnificently haunted
the perfect subject for a chapter in my next book
but my research is complete
and my need for a base of operations
is not nearly so great as yours
and he slides the deed over to you all as
uh he kind of like
stands up very proudly that
this will be a
sufficient replacement for what was promised
uh
no he promised us gold
yeah no offense
uh Mister Volo
um
you're making the Assumption that we're
planning to stick together
yeah my fellow is like well I
I understand the concern I
I do I do
I mean this could certainly be flipped
for any number of dragons
look I'm offering it to you for free
it's I
it's just in a um
you know it's a manner that I
I have not taken it to myself to flip for dragons
no no
boy get wait
let's not look the old gift horse in the mouth now uh
it's a lot nicer sleeping here than it is uh
at the gambling hall don't you think
no well
stitch this isn't the troll school manor
uh
this could be a complete shit hole for all we know no
but I guess free real estate is free real estate
it's no
it's not free because
we were supposed to be getting paid for something
so well
you're not giving us something for free
we did work
what is the condition of this so called estate
may I ask yeah
Reneer Reneer steps forward
he's like well
what my friend is trying to say here is that
he's offering you a tangible piece of the city
it's true the place is a fixer upper
it's been abandoned for a couple years
but its bones are good
it could be a home or with the right investment
a tavern
you know perhaps like 15 gold or so for repairs
guild licenses
it could be a headquarters
a far greater gift than a pouch of coins
even if it comes with some splinters
before we agree to this
we're gonna need to examine this I think I suggest
I'm not willing to um
say yes without examining the property first
okay I think that's prudent
yeah I'm good with
I'm good with checking it out first
uh whose name would you sign the uh
the deed over to though well
it could be all of you or it could be
Abby's really easy to spell
yes could be negotiated Kate's even easier
I would suggest that a piece of it belongs to all of us
evenly
um as is payment
but I I wouldn't say no to having property
I have no other place than the temple myself to stay at
so this could be agreeable
but well I would
be very careful with how you broker deals
in the future
oh of course agreed uh
he he does uh
like continue on remembering some of the fine print
he says there is a small matter of the city's estate
transfer tax a trifle really
125 gold dragons payable to the magistrate who wishes
witnesses the transfer uh
standard bureau and he's like almost finishing this
Renier is like Volo don't be ridiculous
you can't give a gift and then ask them to pay for it
and he turns to y'all and he's like
don't trouble yourselves with that
I will see that Vela has the funds to cover the fee
consider it a small additional token of my gratitude
maybe write a book about Gray Oo's mating rituals
next time I've heard it's the uh the big thing
perhaps we should examine this property
so we could make a decision
an informed decision yeah
um who has the highest passive perception
I not me I think it's gonna be likely Moria yeah
Moria Kailyn or possibly I've got Sudara
I've got fifteen
I'm at 9 14 what does that get me
I'm at 14 alright
where the fuck where do I see Sudara and Mora
uh
you would definitely see fluid has definitely been like
detached from this conversation since uh
Volo has arrived uh
he's wandered over to one of the windows
and he's looking out at the street uh
or it appears to be that he's looking out at the street
for a moment uh
he kind of has a utterly blank expression on his face
uh and you're watching him uh
for but a moment his lips are moving and it takes uh
but that moment that you catch him in this weird state
that he like
snaps back to his usual self
and kind of rejoins the group uh
would very quietly what a wonderful idea
I should be delighted to be your first customer
he's kind of like
like catching up on none of what you've talked about
I would very quietly share um
that insight with the rest of my party
same
sure
uh
Ranier it might be a good idea to uh
to get some
healer or medical professional to stop by your uh
your estate to look at uh flun
agreed yeah
he he
he agrees he's
he's like oh I've already
summoned the finest
as soon as their schedules permit on this busy holiday
maybe uh
maybe maybe
heavy their pockets
to put you at the top of the priority list
agreed again
hey do you have a uh
strong lad about the premises one
of your servants pretty good in uh
pretty good and stout you got one of them
yeah I
I I
has a feeling
you might want to make him his personal watchman
for a little bit keep him glued
okay yeah
one ones that suffer through this tend to
tend to be worse on themselves than anybody else is
if you understand what I'm saying
yeah he does
yeah
I don't know
sorry he hurt himself
no yeah sorry
go ahead no
no no
I was gonna change subject
so you continue
I'm good
well uh
should we go check out this uh
troll skull manor
yes I would like to see it before we make a decision
I think
alright I'm fine with the stroll
alright well
you should uh
you should come with us
that way we can make our decision uh
on the spot when we get there okay
oh excellent
Volo will go with you let's go back to the uh
overall map
let's change brand or tall because you've been here now
uh
I've been doing like purple as our primary city color
works for me
Troll Skull Manor
alright so Troll Skull Manor is uh in yep
the North Ward over here ah
found it yep okay
oh it's alley
it's the alleyway yeah
the alleyway it's gotta be around here
the Manor is this this one in particular
oh okay
I'm not seeing a yep
a thing for it okay
uh oh I
meant to mention that for you
so if you go uh on the left menu
down to journal notes
it's the one that looks like the penant
yeah if I haven't clicked
I see all the other ones oh okay
you don't see one in particular
maybe let's see
how about I don't see oh
there it is cool
alright
that's where the Troll School Manor is on the map
uh yeah
so uh
you follow through the neighborhoods
uh Volo
uh pleasant tree lined streets of the North Ward
the neighbors you pass are well dressed
the buildings are stately and clean
and then you see it
uh the Troll Skull
Manor sits like a rotten tooth in a smiling mouth
uh it's a four story nightmare of sagging rooftops
boarded up windows crumbling balconies
a thick coat of grimy Ivy
seems to be the only thing holding the stone
walls together a faded
swinging sign depicts a grinning skull
with three spectral
blue trolls peeking out from its eye sockets
the entire building has a palpable aura of neglect
and forgotten memories
the front doors are chained and padlocked
uh the lock groans in uh
in its place thick blankets of cobwebs hang from uh
all of the uh
like overhangs and balconies and you can see uh
water damage warped
warped boards
uh
yeah
yep complete piece of shit
hi hi Morden hi
hello what is this
ah gentlemen
this is a
this is a
you know rose to be had
it's just a a garden to be tended away from being a
a fine property and if you know it's not to your taste
then
I'm sure that there are some other suitable buyers
out there I was uh
I was bid against it in the auction that I wanted in
I'm sure that somebody
would be willing to take it off your hands
I just didn't have the time to put it up for auction
and collect that coin
I didn't want to come empty handed to make payment
I thought this would be a suitable alternative
considering my situation
look you found my boy alive
and all of you are still in one piece
I think this is agreeable is it not
uh can we go to open up the front door
actually walk inside oh yeah yes
unlock the place so we can see inside
follow produces a large key
uh yeah
I'll snag it and unlock the door and open it
yeah
uh
oh geez
uh yep
that's dusty
the air is stale with a smell of dust and decay
every piece of furniture is draped in a white sheet
looking like a silent gathering of ghosts
you can see the scale damage everywhere
water stands uh
warped boards
uh there's a deep bone chill
that has
really nothing to do with the outside temperature
uh Reindeer's estimate of 15 gold pieces for a pair
suddenly feels terrifyingly optimistic
uh you are
staring at particularly rotten beams
splintered door frames
uh and I would say that as you are uh uh
as you're standing there uh
Cade you've
you've actually gone into the place
is that correct
mm hmm yep
as well I
okay here we're gonna go everybody too
yeah I'm going as well
yep man
I love you guys what are you talking about
I can't delete my little blue markings on the map
I apologize I don't okay
something's not working
alright this
I'm still working on putting together all of this
but this is what the base of this will look like
and
I'm just gonna configure this so that you can
zoom out and see all the layers
uh collectively so there you go
this is what the inside of the manner will look like
for you but uh
yeah it
it looks uh looks to be quite rough
I have some other notes here
here we go yep
pushing open the front a heavy front door
a wave of cold still air washes over you
carrying the distinct scent of long abandoned places
mildew dust
and something else like old coins or forgotten blood
the grand entry hallway is swallowed in gloom
uh cobwebs
thick and gossamer
drape like tattered mourning shrouds
from every rafter and chandelier
swing almost imperceptibly as you enter
the floorboards groan beneath your weight
a chorus of protesting whispers
from the very structure of the house
barely visible beneath layers of
dust and debris you can make out the faint
intricate patterns of once were elegant
inlaid tiles in the floor
to your left there's now a decaying staircase
to your right is a long mahogany bar
its surface dull and scarred
there's empty overturned stools
there's shattered tankards on the floor there's
the lingering scent of stale ale
and there's a like
a chill in the bar that seems to be a little colder
than the rest of the house
uh the walls are stripped of their former Granger
revealing patches of crumbling plaster
and water stained wallpaper
is Volo in here with us yeah
I think Volo would have stepped in here as well
so you you
you mentioned that
and I don't know if it was a figure of speech polo
but you said this place was uh
uh absolutely haunted
um
what did you end up
what did you end up buying this place for
well I bought this to study uh
the poltergeist and uh I
oh no
I meant how much how many dragoons did you spend
oh uh
that's actually really or dragons
let me let me see if I can find that
Sudara would um
explore all of the levels
basement to rooftop yeah
just walking around quietly
observing and taking everything in
uh
Volo would reveal that he paid 16 gold pieces for it
originally
and did he say it would take 15 to restore this place
Renier Renier suspected it would
be about 15 to restore this place
am I able to tell looking as I tour the
the building if that's accurate
uh yeah
go ahead and make for me what would be
do you have any skills in that matter
uh insight maybe
I don't know yeah
I'll let you do insight or uh
just a straight wisdom like what would your
what would your experience say
so you want just a wisdom roll
we can do that yeah
let's just do pure wisdom
nice
I yeah
I mean I think that uh
just
just the woodwork alone I think that you've seen
you'd probably be in the 15 Mark
uh
you have noted a number of missing or broken windows
so you would need the
Glassblowers Guild to come in and replace them
uh
you probably noticed some of the plaster on the walls
is coming uh
loose and you probably need the Plasterers
Guild to come in and uh
replaster the uh
areas that are of concern
uh
probably even like the uh
Roofers Guild
to come in and sure up any of the leaks in the
4C four different layers that are set up here
yeah the
the 15 estimate certainly seems very low for even your
uh untrained eyes Sudara
so 15 is very very low
could I conservatively double that
or do I not have any idea
I mean is this building at least structurally sound
uh yeah
I mean I like
I think that you uh
would notice some areas as you got higher up like uh
climbing the staircases you were
you know skipping some stairs on your way up
you know there's okay
there's some floorboards that are missing higher you go
I mean there
it's got good it's got good enough bones
but you would need to do some serious work here to
to
for it to be considered a like operable tavern
hmm
the upstairs
they're connected with the downstairs
or they're separate so there's
there's three layers above you
there's a uh
a second floor with like a library
um all of the western facing portions have a open porch
so here I'm just gonna Mark the porches for you
so these would be the porches
oh
alright so those are open
open air to the outside uh
there is
this is uh
is the basement this uh
stone room
which comes down from this hatch in the kitchen space
back here
great I am yeah
cause this is out of character
this is a little bit different than the um
original it is um
alright no worries
the green area on the second floor
what is that it's like a
uh 3 seasons room uh
where uh
looks like obviously some plants could be grown
okay and the upper three floors
we could basically turn into our headquarters
and keep that separate from the tavern
yes mmm hmm
okay so I will rejoin the rest of the
party with a ha ha
um grim look on my face and you know
my hands are clasped behind my back
and I'll just kind of you know shake my head um
my new friends
this is gonna take a little bit more than 15
dragons to fix up and by a little bit more
I mean at least double
and please understand that I'm not a dwarf
I'm not a stone Mason or a woodworker
feel free to look around as I have
but while structurally sound
this place is in shambles
I appreciate that clarification
uh Sudara
I honestly for the this entire time I've known you
I thought you were a door
uh
honestly I mean
I'm okay with with
you know trying this out uh
kind of tired of uh
that little uh
little one room house we got
if you'd even call it that stitch
yeah I think
I'm muted
there you go uh
stitch is gonna look around um
and as he does
he just kind of like randomly kicks walls and stuff
not really
cause it does anything
but just to look like he knows what he's doing
um I'm not opposed to
us accepting this
I simply want us to realize what we might be in store
for
now at the end of the day
if it doesn't work out
we could always just sell the place like
like Volo
yeah sell it at an auction
but I mean it seems like
it's either take this or get nothing agreed um
cause we own it doesn't mean we have to run the bar
we could just
we could just operate a bit of a a home base and
and who knows by the time we get so wealthy
we might need this just to
just to get rid of some of the gold
pouring out of our pocket hmm
we're gonna launder the money
I haven't done that in a while
maybe the tavern operates itself
we get a bartender and whatever I
I don't know how any of that works
um I would be hesitant to call it a tavern
if we occupy the top floors
it would be more like a bar
well I I and again
I don't know how this works
but an inn would have a bar room and rooms for patrons
a tavern is just the bar room
am I mistaken
that might be how the
how the wealthy nobles classify it
but I mean once you get down to the
the average citizen and the people
it's kind of a synonymous
but as long as that's all for the
the future far in the future
nothing to worry about now I have a suggestion
please
I would state that we accept this from Volo however
due to Volo not giving us what
he agreed upon on our initial contact
we should get all
get a percentage of royalties from his next publishing
and the house hmm
I like her
Volo would definitely have to consider that
uh but I mean
you can see this in perpetuity
yeah
you can see he's in a tough position that he
you know showed up with this is like
he desperately
just didn't want to show up empty handed
so he would definitely be uh
willing to uh
take it out uh alright
he's like now the royalties you speak of uh
is this the
book on the poltergeist that I'm about to publish
or is this the one that I'm waiting on payment for
from Baldur's Gate
all your skate okay
he's like okay
well I right
I I personally
think that we could get far more value from Volo
that does not require him to get rid of his royalties
for his book
if you sponsored the troll skull in
once we get it operational
that could grant us far more income
long term than royalties would
hmm
he's intrigued in this like pay the bar
the royalties
and then potentially recoup some income down the line
I think he's definitely interested in that deal
for sure
I do want to remind you all
that you are expecting payment in like
the next 7 6
or 7 days from the city of Water Deep
for your initial recovery of the diplomat
so there's a oh yeah
a hefty purse you're expecting to come in here soon
Kade is not optimistic about receiving that money
from the government
haha
uh but yeah
alright so good point
what's what are we accepting here
are we accepting a sponsorship plus this place
or this place in royalties in perpetuity
Kade's vote would be for the sponsorship and the
the place plus also him paying
him paying those
him paying the taxes to the city that need to be paid
he has to do that as well
but uh yeah
the sponsorship I mean
mainly just like his name on
like
being associated with it would be good for business
cause Volo is very well known yeah
that if you know
it would be like if JK Rowling
not JK Rowling
if JRR Tolkien was like sponsoring a tavern
um fans of his books would probably visit it
just to see what it was about
so basically a brand ambassador yeah
you know like Tiger Woods wearing Nike all the time
yeah you kinda helps
helps throw a little bit of money towards the price of
the booze yeah
cause it would be beneficial for him too
okay I'm in whatever you guys suggest
yeah let's go with that then okay
the manager's off yeah
yeah he will take yeah
we'll agree we'll take it okay
he's cool I'll
I will write up a contract for next session
I just wanna confirm I
I know that we had
two folks said that they wanted to go right
at 9 I think they were yeah
9 0 yeah
I mean I yeah
just wanna let uh
let them make their moves if they need to
um we can continue playing
everybody else for like another 30 minutes or so
if you'd like so just wanted to throw that out there
but yep if you guys keep going that's
that's fine Kade would just walk over to this couch
kind of brush off whatever he uh
little debris and then kind of lay on it
cause he is still kind of hurting from that uh
that strike gotcha
on his uh
side but yeah
I gotta I gotta bounce out
I think he's also gonna uh
go uh
to sleep as well um
I appreciate it guys this week was fun thanks
yep see you bud
absolutely have a good one
uh I'm also gonna bounce
okay sounds good
um we're gonna need to figure out who takes what room
and what we're gonna do with the upstairs and basement
and whatever at some point yep
uh
this is when we get into kind of like spreadsheet play
uh I will post this image
so that you have the image of the
in
I will post the
like kind of directions that you can go with things
so I will also share the
uh contract from Volo uh
in which she sponsors
uh sponsors your establishment
uh
anything else for next session that you guys want me to
uh prepare for
uh I
we will definitely lean to going into the blue alley
uh
Hank how do you want to deal with your character
do you want your character to still participate in
uh that
or do you want to specifically
follow what I had mentioned
where you'll go for your Smithing trials
I think going for my Smithing trials
makes the most sense okay
for long term goals okay
uh so yeah
I think uh
the
levels of encounter
will probably not be as difficult as uh
the gray ooze that you encountered
so I don't think that it would be a concern for
the party to be down one member
even if it's the cleric uh
so okay then for you
uh let's see one of my notes here
uh
so after you've been at the Manor for some time
a fresh uh uh
a runner has come uh
not a fresh faced runner
but a stern faced dwarf in a leather apron
uh the kind that has spent countless hour
hours at the forge the dwarf's eyes sharp as a chisel
uh meet yours almost uh
with unblinking intensity
without a word he produces a heavy Parchment scroll
its edges slightly curled from being tightly rolled
it wasn't sealed with common wax
but with a dollop of gleaming lead
stamped precisely with the
unmistakable Mark of the guild
a hammer striking a flawless ingot
this was no ordinary message
he reaches out and hands you the scroll
break the seal and read it immediately
yeah it's a
almost ritualistic uh
language but it's a communication
from the most careful order of skilled
smiths and metal forgers
uh there's a revelation uh
a vacancy
has opened on their esteemed roster of masters
uh and this can only be explained that uh
it's come through the uh death of a former master
uh
and uh
you're kind of taken back by the sadness of losing
losing a master but are kind of overwhelmed by the
excitement of this opportunity
yeah do you any specific response you have
I am saddened by the loss of a brother Smith
but this is a call to
an opportunity that I have worked my life for
I shall not say no
uh
the this will benefit all in my range when I am done
the uh Smith uh runner uh
accepts your response uh
he offers you a second scroll
uh this one is uh not
sealed with the signal of or the signet of the guild
the hammer and the perfect ingot
uh
but this is a ranking member of the clergy of Moradin
that are
members of the Metal Smithing Guild
this particular contact
her name is High Priestess Orlega
you would know her because she uh
legendarily crafted
a set of smithing tools out of Mithral
and she's known for crafting
but when the master stroke is to be struck
she will often
allow her second hammer to take that master stroke
and so the revelation of a uh second scroll from the
High Priestess would certainly set you back
and the runner hands this one to you as well
I'm not I'm not sure I
I follow what am I
what am I to do here no
it's a so he's just
just offering you roleplay for a
the the High Priestess
uh
essentially
you're getting a very high ranking member of the Guild
as the recommending
uh like your
it's a letter of recommendation from
this member of the guild and she ah
okay
Super honor got it
super honor yeah
ah
uh I will I will look humbled and
Morden has blessed this day
for I have been found worthy amongst my own kind
and I shall prove my worth to Morden
by forging the fire of Mithral
so I swear by my beard hair
and so yeah
with these two documents you uh
you know
that you have a month's time to forge your masterwork
uh the uh
sorry I have the
I realized I have the letters
I typed them up for you uh
let me
I'm just gonna send these to you directly in discord
hopefully I can paste them all in one go
and while you do that DM
I'm gonna take off but just for planning purposes
um Cedera would send a um
message back to um
I'm drawing a blank on the um
weapon master's name or maybe the at uh yeah yeah
one of the I'd send a message back to the
um
monastery um
this is what's going on
this is where I'm at kind of thing
and we can talk more about that later
okay yeah
you can ping me on that
alright thank you
good night guys good night
I've uh
pinged you directly with those two letters
what they say to you specifically there Mora
thank you
Roach uh
would you have uh
eventually made your way back to high radiance uh
or yes okay
I'm willing to roleplay out anything with that
that you would like
no I think uh
Caitlin would just report everything
that happened in the source
uh and report the state of madness of flun
that he encountered uh
and specifically
what information they were trying to deprive from him
related to Lord Neverember
um because Lord Neverember is not the best man
right of water deep
so uh
he would basically give high radiance everything
like a base a full report on everything that happened
okay yeah
uh
the high radiance would definitely take all of that in
uh
she would uh
give you some counsel
The Xanathar Guild is a festering wound
in this city's underbelly
a source of corruption that has long defied cleansing
we felt however
that chilling presence of such profound malevolence
that is a deeper concern than mere thuggery
sewers
have always been a place where darkness congregates
uh and she was like uh
just reading through my notes here just a little bit
uh yes she's she's
like your venture into that darkness
though perilous has illuminated a
a grave threat to our sacred vigilance
and she gestures uh
with a subtle dip of her chin to Prior Athosar
who is standing in the room
he's holding a polished wooden chest uh
and it's uh
she says to you uh
first your duties to the order's ongoing support
your unwavering devotion is noted
as are your Templar duties
the order relies upon your tithe
to continue its good works
to spread Lathander's light where the shadows cling
she expects you to donate some money towards the church
but okay um
how much that's up to you
is there like a no time
I'm yeah
I'm gonna let you decide how much
like how much you feel the church is giving to you
and I'm definitely gonna balance
uh
on the back end but I'll let you decide
I'm not gonna give you a I'm not giving you a number
you're giving yourself a number
um
what's what's kind of relative in this situation
in this economy I would say because okay
so yeah a single gold is the equivalent of like $100
okay I will give 10 gold
10 gold okay
so go down to 5 5 3
there we go yep
uh I have this set here for you
I wanted to just bring you to the scene
because I can do this uh
let's do this let's do this
let's do this
uh configure
alright so
activate
uh when you uh
tide the prior steps forward with this chest uh
and uh
inside are
um four carefully secured stoppered bottles
two potions of healing
one potion of strength and one potion of heroism
uh the prior says
return the empty vials
and they shall be refilled when you're
when you are due next
uh this is a great blessing
this will certainly help in the perils to come
from the chest you should be able to double click
oh was it
they actually aren't in it interesting
I have I took them
oh you already took them perfect yes yes
okay cool
cool cool
uh
alright so that was uh
what I had prepared for the interaction
I do have some more stuff prepared for
the high radiance uh
if you wanna uh
continue into other uh directions
um essentially I'm gonna give you some uh
hooks for uh
investigating the zenterim and then uh
two
uh
Underdark related factions
the Dark Daggers and the anchorites of Talos
all three are like direct uh
foes of Lathander
so I'll go into that a little bit more
so that you'll have that in character
next time we play
but just wanted to give you a heads up on that
if you have any particular direction
you'd like to go with enemies of Lafender
let me know but those three are the big ones that I had
yeah let's take those
okay cool
uh alright Chris I
think that covers the two solo scenes
I wanted to focus on for you
uh
I know it's down to just the awesome
the three of us
but anything that you wanted to feedback on
what went well what didn't go well
what could be done better
uh this particular session
uh I would say music
um I've never seen a DM
even the most talented DMs
be able to pull off the music thing
um for me
it's kind of personally distracting to have music
um I hope you can pull it off
but I just haven't been able to see anyone
kind of successfully do it
because once you know
there's music and then there's four or five
you know booming voices over that music
things get kind of frantic
so I typically put it on a really low volume
or I simply just mute it
like I understand it as the ambiance
but in my time I just haven't been able to
to see anyone pull it off successfully
yeah respect
I uh
I struggled with that
it seems like it's a hit for some people
and all I did was play it in the background
uh I agree though
if you wanna mute it feel free to dump that uh
user to 0 and I
I think we can continue playing as we had before
but uh
I did uh
get good feedback from uh
Cade on that so I will try to interject it where
I can won't be overwhelming
come here I
I think if you it depends if you keep selecting it um
the right stuff and I also controlled like
I turned it down to about 50% already
and I thought it I thought it um
went into the background quite well from
I had it at like but I could see
I could see some tracks being disruptive
did did um
uh so Kailyn get all the items there
it looked like only potion of healing went yeah
he got all of them out of inventory okay
no I got them all uh
potion of heal giant strength
potion of heroism and 2 potions of healing yep
that's right
Hank anything uh feedback from you
um I'm a little bit on the other side of it
but all my experience with music
in the background was in person
so I I don't know how valid my opinion is accurately
yeah
so there's that I
I've enjoyed the loot system that's new
it's a little videogamey I like that cool
so I I think that's cool
and it makes people explore and open things up
and check for stuff if it's on the ground
so I like that I
I can imagine that technically that's a lot of effort
so still cool
yeah definitely will try to do that
and like uh
I I
I'm sorry I'm awful with real names
I'm just gonna call everybody by their character names
that Havoc's Havoc's player was uh
mentioning that in that uh
I can have them like
hidden and reveal them to you on dice roll as well
so definitely
something I plan to do in the future is to have them
more uh
interspersed and oh
I have to search this room
okay and then reveal that after the fact
so he looted that while the oozes were
I know he did he coming through too
he didn't even tell you guys till after it was gone
yeah
that's very gobliney of him though
yeah I love role playing
yeah it was
it was I feel like a lot of good role play this session
yeah it was good one
one thing Sean
if you are placing stuff um
if there are actually hidden things
I think that at some point it's
you're
training your players to only see what you've placed
so make sure there's some kind of yeah
distinction or that you have some way that
that it's um
obviously can't make it
you can't make it explicit in every case
but things that are obvious
I think it does make uh
good sense I think
like things that are actually laying there
that you wouldn't have to search for
it makes good sense yep
cool uh
hey anything else that you want to wrap up
before you're gone for two sessions
I've already got you squared away with skipping them
uh and then sweet
I'll set it so that you're I
I'll just start adding new sessions with you returning
after that um
I don't think there's anything else you need to do it
it I saw that it's only 4 or 5 so we should be good for
you
not needing to do anything for your next two sessions
sweet so uh
we don't need to do anything
for the actual thematics of it
you don't have anything there
we're just gonna call it done
and pick it back up when I get back yep
uh depending on what the party accumulates
while you're gone
I was planning on probably giving you something
thematically equivalent like a
maybe a plus 1 weapon on return
uh just depends on what the party gets
sure okay
uh I'm always open to Shields and armor too
okay cool
they're uh
they're easier to stamp with more than symbol yep
awesome well yeah
that's all I had okay cool
roach anything
I'll uh
see you guys in uh
couple weeks yeah
have a good trip man
that's super exciting can't wait to hear about it
yeah buddy
hope you and the wife stay safe out there
oh absolutely will
it's gonna be a blast I'm super stoked
three years in the making
let's go ha ha ha
but not the end I'm good
um we're
we're set for next session
cool sounds good
alright also
thanks guys y'all have fun alright
thank you alright
yeah so thanks for sticking around on that
one um
yeah I
I think I'm doing better in certain areas and uh
it's just like you said it's just all
every session is a practice run for my next session
so
I need to stop the recording
okay
